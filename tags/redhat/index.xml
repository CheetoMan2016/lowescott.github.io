          <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a couple of previous posts, I have several servers running Red Hat Linux 9.0 that I am looking to upgrade to a newer distribution. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a couple of recent versions of CentOS (a clone version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux), but ran into &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;problems with ntpd&lt;/a&gt; (I may have &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/23/centos-ntpd-problem-mostly-resolved/&#34;&gt;finally resolved&lt;/a&gt; those). I&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to give that a try as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/08/ubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;experience with Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;some time with Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;) led me to believe that Debian would be equally polished. So, I downloaded two ISO&amp;rsquo;s for Debian 3.1 (&amp;ldquo;Sarge&amp;rdquo;), the latest stable release. Information I&amp;rsquo;d gained from some online research indicated by this release included a 2.6.8 version of the kernel, but upon installation I found I was running a patched 2.4 version instead. After a couple of attempts to upgrade the kernel via &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, I finally managed to locate an appropriate package name in the stable distribution and installed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the 2.6.8 kernel cause the system to fail to boot, listing numerous segmentation faults and finally just halting partway into the boot process. I was extremely disappointed&amp;mdash;after having spent that time downloading the software and then installing it, it was now completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that Debian fans will point out that I surely did something incorrect and things normally don&amp;rsquo;t happen that way. Perhaps that is true; I will certainly be the first to admit that I may have done something incorrectly while using &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; to upgrade the kernel. I would be nice to know exactly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it was that went wrong, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m going to shelve Debian GNU/Linux as a possible replacement OS and continue searching. At this point, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; is starting to look really good&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>NTPd on CentOS 4.2</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I started working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; (version 4.1 at the time, see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/08/brief-impressions-of-centos-41/&#34;&gt;impressions&lt;/a&gt; here) as a candidate replacement for the Red Hat Linux 9.0-based servers still in service on the network. Although I was (and still am) very comfortable with Red Hat Linux 9.0, it&amp;rsquo;s getting a bit long in the tooth and I wanted to update the servers to a more modern software base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I kept running into &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;issues with time synchronization&lt;/a&gt; on the CentOS server. This time synchronization issue did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; appear on the Red Hat Linux servers. I tried to resolve the issue, but never did find the solution. Instead, I just used ntpdate in a cron job. That seemed to work well enough, but I really wanted it to work PROPERLY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started working with CentOS 4.2 earlier this week, hoping that whatever had plagued me with the previous version wouldn&amp;rsquo;t afflict me this time. Unfortunately, the exact same problem has cropped up again, and I am at a loss trying to figure out why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. The output from &lt;code&gt;ntpq -p&lt;/code&gt; indicates that communication is occurring with the desired time servers, but the NTP daemon still keeps choosing to synchronize with the local clock. SELinux is disabled, so it can&amp;rsquo;t be interfering with NTP (I think that was the problem with the earlier CentOS 4.1 installation), &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; is not running (so it can&amp;rsquo;t be a firewall issue), file permissions and ownership look OK&amp;mdash;what could I be missing? If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
