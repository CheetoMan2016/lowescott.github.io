          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, barring some unforeseen disaster or God leading us otherwise, my wife and I are going to Stockholm, Sweden, around Labor Day. A good friend of mine is getting married and we&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to the wedding. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit scary, as the only foreign country I have ever visited was Mexico, and that was to a high-traffic tourist area. Somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that thousands of Americans visit Stockholm in September every year. Anybody know any Swedish?&lt;/p&gt;
