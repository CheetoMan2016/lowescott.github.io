          <description>&lt;p&gt;In an update to my previous article on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/28/windows-metafile-flaw-already-being-exploited/&#34;&gt;Windows Metafile flaw&lt;/a&gt;, new reports are coming in of greater use of malicious WMF files that take advantage of the flaw, especially by adware companies. Numerous sites are reporting that malicious WMF files are being used in ad rotations on third-party sites. For more information, see one of the following articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts Fret as Adware Makers Leverage WMF Flaw
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1906915,00.asp&#34;&gt;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1906915,00.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical Impact: Windows Metafile Flaw a &amp;lsquo;Zero-Day Exploit&amp;rsquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1906177,00.asp&#34;&gt;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1906177,00.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are details on just how easy it is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8879?CMP=OTC-6YE827253101&amp;amp;ATT=Exploiting+the+Windows+XP/2003+Picture+and+Fax+Viewer+Metafile+Overflow+Vulnerability&#34;&gt;take advantage of this vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; available as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particularly bad part of this whole situation is that users don&amp;rsquo;t have to do a thing&amp;mdash;just visiting a web site with a malicious WMF file can affect your system. And this isn&amp;rsquo;t an Internet Explorer flaw, either, lest you think that using Firefox will keep you safe. No, this is a &lt;em&gt;Windows&lt;/em&gt; flaw, and Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, etc., are all affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that a good workaround (not unregistering the shimgvw.dll file, which also disables previewing other image formats in Windows Explorer) emerges soon.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Windows Metafile Flaw Already Being Exploited</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Two separate reports (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1906177,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article from eWeek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,107375,00.html&#34;&gt;this article from ComputerWorld&lt;/a&gt;) have risen today regarding a &amp;ldquo;zero-day&amp;rdquo; exploit of a vulnerability in Windows&amp;rsquo; handling of WMF (Windows Metafile) images. According to the reports, simply viewing a WMF file (such as from a web site) can infect your computer. Sunbelt Software&amp;rsquo;s blog also offers &lt;a href=&#34;http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/new-exploit-blows-by-fully-patched.html&#34;&gt;more details on the vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; as well. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16074/info&#34;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; from SecurityFocus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the reports, this newly discovered WMF vulnerability will allow crackers to run the code of their choice on the affected system(s). So far, the exploit has been limited to installing spyware, adware, and keyloggers, but there is little doubt in anyone&amp;rsquo;s mind that the attackers will grow much worse very quickly. The vulnerability can be exploited in a variety of ways, such as visiting hostile web sites (using either Internet Explorer, Opera, or Firefox); opening an affected WMF file in Windows Picture and Fax Viewer; or previewing an affected file in Windows Explorer. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this vulnerability affects even fully patched systems &lt;em&gt;with all available patches installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the only workaround is to uninstall Windows from your computer and immediately install Linux. OK, just kidding. Seriously, though, the only known workaround at this time is to unregister the affected DLL using this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;regsvr32 /u shimgvw.dll
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; when prompted. This unregisters the affected DLL and eliminates the vulnerability; however, this may also affect the viewing and previewing of many other types of images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still early yet in the discovery process, so I fully anticipate that more workarounds and more information will emerge as the security researchers continue their work.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Initial Impressions of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a couple of previous posts, I have several servers running Red Hat Linux 9.0 that I am looking to upgrade to a newer distribution. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a couple of recent versions of CentOS (a clone version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux), but ran into &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;problems with ntpd&lt;/a&gt; (I may have &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/23/centos-ntpd-problem-mostly-resolved/&#34;&gt;finally resolved&lt;/a&gt; those). I&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to give that a try as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/08/ubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;experience with Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;some time with Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;) led me to believe that Debian would be equally polished. So, I downloaded two ISO&amp;rsquo;s for Debian 3.1 (&amp;ldquo;Sarge&amp;rdquo;), the latest stable release. Information I&amp;rsquo;d gained from some online research indicated by this release included a 2.6.8 version of the kernel, but upon installation I found I was running a patched 2.4 version instead. After a couple of attempts to upgrade the kernel via &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, I finally managed to locate an appropriate package name in the stable distribution and installed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the 2.6.8 kernel cause the system to fail to boot, listing numerous segmentation faults and finally just halting partway into the boot process. I was extremely disappointed&amp;mdash;after having spent that time downloading the software and then installing it, it was now completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that Debian fans will point out that I surely did something incorrect and things normally don&amp;rsquo;t happen that way. Perhaps that is true; I will certainly be the first to admit that I may have done something incorrectly while using &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; to upgrade the kernel. I would be nice to know exactly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it was that went wrong, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m going to shelve Debian GNU/Linux as a possible replacement OS and continue searching. At this point, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; is starting to look really good&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Security Flaw Found in VMware</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/26/security-flaw-found-in-vmware/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2005 21:45:32 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/26/security-flaw-found-in-vmware/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Just so the Windows flaws don&amp;rsquo;t get all the attention, here&amp;rsquo;s a reasonably new one: a flaw in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, the machine virtualization software that is tremendously popular, especially among security professionals. Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s reasonably easy to work around the flaw, and VMware has already released a patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This link offers more details on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1904647,00.asp&#34;&gt;VMware security flaw&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently affects almost all of the VMware products, with the notable exception of ESX Server. VMware&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=2000&#34;&gt;security advisory&lt;/a&gt; also provides complete details and information on how to protect against it, plus a link to download the patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VMware users can sidestep the security issue by not using NAT networking for their virtual machines, as pointed out in the security advisory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While security flaws in Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Windows operating system and Internet Explorer web browser get most of the attention these days, all products have them. Users of Linux or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; like to proclaim their immunity, but no one is immune. This recent vulnerability merely highlights the fact that we must all be vigilant and watchful in order to maintain the security and integrity of our networks and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>CentOS NTPd Problem (Mostly) Resolved</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/23/centos-ntpd-problem-mostly-resolved/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2005 14:50:45 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The NTPd problem that I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;wrestled with in CentOS 4.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;again in CentOS 4.2&lt;/a&gt; has finally been resolved. Mostly. I think. The specific steps I took to resolve the issue came from a number of sources, so read on for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these servers are virtual servers running under &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, I first consulted the VMware Knowledge Base and turned up this article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=Nuh3rAXh&amp;amp;p_lva=&amp;amp;p_faqid=1420&amp;amp;p_created=1093994398&amp;amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9ncmlkc29ydD0mcF9yb3dfY250PTc0MyZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PUxpbnV4IGd1ZXN0IGNsb2NrJnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9NyZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMT1_YW55fiZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMj1_YW55fiZwX3NvcnRfYnk9ZGZsdCZwX3BhZ2U9MQ**&amp;amp;p_li=&#34;&gt;slow and fast clocks for Linux guest VMs&lt;/a&gt;. Based on that information, I added a few extra commands to the grub configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;noapic nosmp nolapic clock=pit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I found a number of forum postings in various sites (too many to list or link here) that referenced problems with NTP and ACPI. So, based on that information, I further edited the grub configuration to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;noapic nosmp nolapic clock=pit acpi=no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, based on information regarding NTP itself and the NTP configuration parameters, I added the &amp;ldquo;burst iburst&amp;rdquo; parameters to the server lines in my &lt;code&gt;ntp.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;server W.X.Y.Z burst iburst
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helped, as at least now NTP would synchronize against something other than the local clock (which was more than it had done previously). For some reason, though, the &lt;code&gt;/var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; log file was filling up with messages about synchronizing against the local clock, then synchronizing against the server, then against the local clock, etc. (You get the picture.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I was synchronizing against a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;-based computer, I thought perhaps that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s NTP implementation was simply broken. (This certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time.) So I configured &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openntpd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenNTPd&lt;/a&gt; on an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; server (running OpenBSD 3.8) and re-configured the CentOS server to synchronize against the OpenBSD NTP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;OpenNTPd is ridiculously simple to configure and operate, and _just works._&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repetitive synchronization messages still appeared, but were appearing with far less frequency. And the time still isn&amp;rsquo;t synchronized to the level I would like, but it does stay within a minute or so of the rest of the network (well within the 5 minute gap required in order for Kerberos authentication to work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s still not working as cleanly as the older Red Hat Linux 9.0-based servers, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; working. Given that I&amp;rsquo;m still running these servers under an old version of VMware (which, technically, doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Linux 2.6 kernels) I may try upgrading to a new version of VMware to see if that helps at all.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Complete Linux-AD Authentication Details</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/22/complete-linux-ad-authentication-details/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2005 11:26:46 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/22/complete-linux-ad-authentication-details/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; These instructions are for Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 pre-R2. For the R2 release, please see &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2007/01/15/linux-ad-integration-version-4/&#34;&gt;these updated instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several articles posted here that discuss, in general terms, how to authenticate Linux against Active Directory. For example, see this brief article on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/13/linux-ad-integration-direction/&#34;&gt;broad direction&lt;/a&gt; of the integration, or this posting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/18/minor-linux-ad-hiccup-fixed-hopefully/&#34;&gt;using computer accounts&lt;/a&gt; for Linux servers (most how-to documents I&amp;rsquo;ve seen discuss the use of a user account for this purpose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having to rebuild one Linux server a number of times in an effort to fix a separate problem (see this article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;NTPd problems with CentOS 4.1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;recurrence of the problem&lt;/a&gt; with CentOS 4.2). As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go through the process of configuring this Linux server (and preparing Active Directory) for authentication several times, and I found that I kept having to go back to my scattered and dispersed notes to remember what had to be done. In the hopes of correcting that, I am collecting all the pertinent information I have here in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Preparing Active Directory (One-Time)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a one-time preparation of Active Directory that is required. In order to authenticate Linux logins against Active Directory, Active Directory&amp;rsquo;s schema must be extended to include Linux-specific attributes such as home directory, UID, GID, and default shell. There are a couple of different ways to do this; I chose to use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Services for Unix (SFU) to extend the schema. There are two reasons I chose SFU: 1) it&amp;rsquo;s free; and 2) the SFU schema is being included by default in Windows Server 2003 R2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once SFU has been installed and the schema has been extended, then the specific Active Directory accounts that are allowed to authenticate via Linux must be configured with a UID and other UNIX attributes. This is accomplished via the new &amp;ldquo;UNIX Attributes&amp;rdquo; tab on the properties dialog box of a user account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to create an account in Active Directory that will be used to bind to Active Directory for LDAP queries. This account does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need any special privileges; in fact, making the account a member of Domain Guests and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a member of Domain Users is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the user accounts have been configured, then we are ready to perform the additional tasks within Active Directory and on the Linux server that will enable the authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Preparing Active Directory (Each Server)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each server that will be authenticating against Active Directory, follow the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a computer account in Active Directory. When creating the computer account, be sure to specify that this account may be used by a pre-Windows 2000-based computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the following command at a command prompt to configure the new computer account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ktpass -princ host/fqdn@REALM -mapuser DOMAIN\name$&lt;br /&gt;
-crypto DES-CBC-MD5 -pass password -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL&lt;br /&gt;
-out filename&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to substitute the appropriate values for &amp;ldquo;fqdn&amp;rdquo; (the fully-qualified domain name of the computer), &amp;ldquo;REALM&amp;rdquo; (the DNS name of your Active Directory domain in UPPERCASE), &amp;ldquo;DOMAIN&amp;rdquo; (the NetBIOS name of your Active Directory domain), &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; (the password that will be set for the new computer account), and &amp;ldquo;filename&amp;rdquo; (the keytab that will be generated and must be copied over to the Linux computer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to rebuild the Linux server for whatever reason, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to delete the computer account you created and repeat this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Preparing the Linux Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the steps below to configure the Linux server for authentication against Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the appropriate Kerberos libraries, OpenLDAP, pam_krb5, and nss_ldap are installed. If they are not installed, install them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure that time is being properly synchronized between Active Directory and the Linux server in question. Kerberos requires time synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;krb5.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to look something like this, substituting your actual host names and domain names where appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[logging]&lt;br /&gt;
 default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log&lt;br /&gt;
 kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log&lt;br /&gt;
 admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[libdefaults]&lt;br /&gt;
 default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM&lt;br /&gt;
 dns_lookup_realm = true&lt;br /&gt;
 dns_lookup_kdc = true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[realms]&lt;br /&gt;
 EXAMPLE.COM = {&lt;br /&gt;
  kdc = host.example.com:88&lt;br /&gt;
  admin_server = host.example.com:749&lt;br /&gt;
  default_domain = example.com&lt;br /&gt;
 }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[domain_realm]&lt;br /&gt;
 .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM&lt;br /&gt;
 example.com = EXAMPLE.COM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[kdc]&lt;br /&gt;
 profile = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[appdefaults]&lt;br /&gt;
 pam = {&lt;br /&gt;
   debug = false&lt;br /&gt;
   ticket_lifetime = 36000&lt;br /&gt;
   renew_lifetime = 36000&lt;br /&gt;
   forwardable = true&lt;br /&gt;
   krb4_convert = false&lt;br /&gt;
 }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;/etc/ldap.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to look something like this, substituting the appropriate host names, domain names, account names, and distinguished names (DNs) where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;host 10.10.10.10
base dc=example,dc=com
binddn cn=ldap,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
bindpw adldapbindpw
scope sub
ssl no
nss_base_passwd dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_shadow dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_group dc=example,dc=com
nss_map_objectclass posixAccount user
nss_map_objectclass shadowAccount user
nss_map_objectclass posixGroup group
nss_map_attribute uid sAMAccountName
nss_map_attribute uidNumber msSFU30UidNumber
nss_map_attribute gidNumber msSFU30GidNumber
nss_map_attribute loginShell msSFU30LoginShell
nss_map_attribute gecos name
nss_map_attribute userPassword msSFU30Password
nss_map_attribute homeDirectory msSFU30HomeDirectory
nss_map_attribute uniqueMember msSFU30PosixMember
nss_map_attribute cn cn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securely copy the file created using the &lt;code&gt;ktpass.exe&lt;/code&gt; utility above to the Linux server in question, placing it in the &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; directory as &lt;code&gt;krb5.keytab&lt;/code&gt;. (SFTP or SCP are excellent candidates for this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure PAM (this varies according to Linux distributions) to use pam_krb5 for authentication. Many modern distributions use a stacking mechanism whereby one file can be modified and those changes will applied to all the various PAM-aware services. For example, in Red Hat-based distributions, the system-auth file is referenced by most other PAM-aware services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;/etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to include &amp;ldquo;ldap&amp;rdquo; as a lookup source for passwd, shadow, and groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be it. Once you do that, you should be able to use &lt;code&gt;kinit&lt;/code&gt; from a Linux shell prompt (for example, &lt;code&gt;kinit aduser&lt;/code&gt;) and generate a valid Kerberos ticket for the specified Active Directory account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, any PAM-aware service that is configured to use the stacked system file (such as the system-auth configuration on Red Hat-based distributions) will use Active Directory for authentication. Note, however, that unless you also add the &lt;code&gt;pam_mkhomedir.so&lt;/code&gt; module in the PAM configuration, home directories will have to be created manually for any Active Directory account that may log on to that server. (I generally recommend the use of &lt;code&gt;pam_mkhomedir.so&lt;/code&gt; in this situation.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2005 16:08:20 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I started working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; (version 4.1 at the time, see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/08/brief-impressions-of-centos-41/&#34;&gt;impressions&lt;/a&gt; here) as a candidate replacement for the Red Hat Linux 9.0-based servers still in service on the network. Although I was (and still am) very comfortable with Red Hat Linux 9.0, it&amp;rsquo;s getting a bit long in the tooth and I wanted to update the servers to a more modern software base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I kept running into &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;issues with time synchronization&lt;/a&gt; on the CentOS server. This time synchronization issue did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; appear on the Red Hat Linux servers. I tried to resolve the issue, but never did find the solution. Instead, I just used ntpdate in a cron job. That seemed to work well enough, but I really wanted it to work PROPERLY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started working with CentOS 4.2 earlier this week, hoping that whatever had plagued me with the previous version wouldn&amp;rsquo;t afflict me this time. Unfortunately, the exact same problem has cropped up again, and I am at a loss trying to figure out why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. The output from &lt;code&gt;ntpq -p&lt;/code&gt; indicates that communication is occurring with the desired time servers, but the NTP daemon still keeps choosing to synchronize with the local clock. SELinux is disabled, so it can&amp;rsquo;t be interfering with NTP (I think that was the problem with the earlier CentOS 4.1 installation), &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; is not running (so it can&amp;rsquo;t be a firewall issue), file permissions and ownership look OK&amp;mdash;what could I be missing? If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/13/installing-linux-on-an-ipaq-h3765/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I switched to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, I was a heavy duty &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; user. I had Windows XP on my laptop, Windows 2000 on my servers, and used a Windows CE-based Compaq iPaq H3765. Since that time, I (of course) switched to Mac OS X on my laptop (a 15&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; G4 with SuperDrive); a mix of Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows on my servers; and a Palm OS-based handheld (currently a Treo 650, previously a Tungsten T3). As a result, I still had this iPaq sitting around doing nothing. So, on a whim, I decided to install Linux on my old iPaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://familiar.handhelds.org/releases/v0.8.2/install/&#34;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; at familiar.handhelds.org, I downloaded an &lt;a href=&#34;http://opie.handhelds.org/&#34;&gt;Opie&lt;/a&gt; image, installed the bootloader, and reflashed the iPaq from a spare 128MB CF card (I had a CF sleeve with external battery for the iPaq). After only a few minutes (the entire process was really quite painless), I was up and running with Linux on my iPaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having Linux running on the iPaq is great, but now I have to figure out what to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with this Linux-based PDA. Suggestions, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Application-Specific VPNs</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/13/application-specific-vpns/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 13 Dec 2005 11:18:37 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/13/application-specific-vpns/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I coined the term &amp;ldquo;application specific VPNs&amp;rdquo; as I began exploring the many uses of tools such as SSH (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssh.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; implementation, in particular) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt; (the open source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/a&gt; wrapper). An &amp;ldquo;application specific VPN&amp;rdquo; is a technique for employing encrypted communication with a particular remote application that does not affect the operation of other applications (local or remote) on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, most VPNs employ technology such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPTP&#34;&gt;PPTP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsec&#34;&gt;IPSec&lt;/a&gt;. These protocols usually affect &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; traffic originating from that system (unless we use split tunneling). With an application specific VPN, only particular types of traffic are affected, and these particular types of traffic are wrapped in an encrypted SSH or SSL tunnel using either OpenSSH or Stunnel, respectively. Other types of traffic are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may seem old hat to long-time Linux, Unix, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; users, this is a relatively new concept to other platforms. Being a (fairly) new convert to Mac OS X myself, I found myself enjoying the tremendous flexibility offered by application specific VPNs. However, this functionality is certainly not limited to these platforms, and it is possible for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; users to utilize this functionality as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Some Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of how you can use application specific VPNs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=186&amp;amp;ntref=PROHOME_Main&#34;&gt;Citrix Presentation Server&lt;/a&gt;: Users can wrap Citrix ICA traffic in SSL using Stunnel; this avoids the need to pay for commercial solutions (although, quite honestly, the commercial solutions are typically easier to deploy and manage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-Mail: Lots of people talk about securing e-mail, but not usually in the context of securing client-to-server traffic. With Stunnel, you can add SSL support for IMAP, POP, and/or SMTP even if the server doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SSL natively. In fact, you can add Stunnel to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Microsoft Exchange&lt;/a&gt; to help bolster that product&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for SSL (such as using SMTPS instead of STARTTLS for encrypting SMTP traffic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote Desktop: This is a great technique for sysadmins. Need to use Remote Desktop to manage a Windows-based server remotely, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to run into security problems? Use Stunnel or OpenSSH to encrypt the RDP traffic. Stunnel, in my opinion, is particularly good here, since it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy to use the Windows port of Stunnel to establish an SSL listener on an arbitrary high port for this very purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Using Stunnel for SSL-based Application Specific VPNs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows, there is no graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring Stunnel; all configuration must be done with the &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; configuration file. A sample &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; file is found below; this file listens on TCP port 1494 and forwards traffic to TCP port 3389 on the same system. (Note that this would be a sample &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; file for a server-side configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CApath = c:\windows\system32\stunnel  
cert = c:\windows\system32\stunnel\stunnel.pem  
client = no  
service = SSLTunnel  
[rdp]  
accept = 1494  
connect = 3389
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Stunnel has been configured, running &lt;code&gt;stunnel --install&lt;/code&gt; will install it as a system service; this service can then be stopped and started through the Services MMC console just like any other background service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only half the work; you&amp;rsquo;ll also need an equivalent Stunnel configuration on the client side, since the Microsoft RDP client (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=80111f21-d48d-426e-96c2-08aa2bd23a49&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&#34;&gt;Windows version&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; version) does not support SSL. Also, note that the SSL certificate used by Stunnel needs to be in PEM format (which is a nice lead-in to my article discussing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/02/certificate-conversion-using-openssl/&#34;&gt;conversion of certificates&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac OS X, there is a graphical utility for managing Stunnel called SSL Enabler. (Note that I was not able to find a home page for this utility; downloads can be found at various sites.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Linux, the configuration again involves editing the &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; file and launching stunnel (either in the foreground or as a daemon). I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any GUI utilities for configuring Stunnel on Linux, but that certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Using SSH for Application Specific VPNs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with Stunnel, it&amp;rsquo;s also possible to use SSH to create application specific VPNs. Mac OS X comes with OpenSSH, as do most distributions of Linux and various flavors of BSD. Windows users can also find various ports of OpenSSH and utilities such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/&#34;&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt; that make it possible to use SSH for application specific VPNs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac OS X, the following command in Terminal will create an application specific VPN to encrypt IMAP traffic to a remote server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -L 1143:imapserver.domain.com:143 -N -f user@sshserver.domain.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same technique could be used to encrypt WebDAV traffic to a remote web server, other types of mail traffic (POP3 or SMTP, for example), RDP (for Remote Desktop), etc. Note that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with HTTP traffic that requires the use of host headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few graphical utilities on Mac OS X for managing SSH tunnels; these include &lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/stm/&#34;&gt;SSH Tunnel Manager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leapingbytes.com/almostvpn&#34;&gt;AlmostVPN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being a regular day-to-day Linux user (not on the desktop, at least), I don&amp;rsquo;t know of any SSH tunnel management applications, but I would be very surprised if they didn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Creating Site-to-Site Application Specific VPNs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the examples so far have been using SSH and/or Stunnel to connect endpoints (i.e., a single laptop or desktop computer) to a remote resource via an application specific VPN. However, it&amp;rsquo;s also easily possible to create application specific site-to-site VPNs, whose purpose is to secure only a particular type of traffic between two locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this example. CompanyA wants to send e-mail to CompanyB, but wants that e-mail to be secure. If both mail servers support TLS, then the organizations could use TLS to secure the SMTP traffic. If not, then the companies can use Stunnel to establish an SSL connection between two systems. HostA at CompanyA can use Stunnel as a client side application to listen for unencrypted connections and pass them as encrypted connections to HostB at CompanyB. HostB at CompanyB is using Stunnel to listen for encrypted connections and passes them unencrypted to the mail server at CompanyB. With a simple configuration, the mail servers at both companies can be configured to pass mail connections for other company through the Stunnel connection. With no additional cost and very little configuration, all e-mail traffic between the two organizations has now been secured. All this without the complexity of a typical B-to-B VPN and the associated access controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, documents on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/downloads/ptd-asvpn-ssh.doc&#34;&gt;application specific VPNs with SSH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/downloads/ptd-asvpn-stunnel.doc&#34;&gt;application specific VPNs with Stunnel&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Using .Mac iDisk with a WatchGuard Firebox</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/12/using-mac-idisk-with-a-watchguard-firebox/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2005 00:37:38 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/12/using-mac-idisk-with-a-watchguard-firebox/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.watchguard.com/&#34;&gt;WatchGuard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.watchguard.com/products/appliances.asp&#34;&gt;Firebox&lt;/a&gt; series of firewalls is the inclusion of application-layer proxies for protocols such as SMTP, FTP, and HTTP. Whereas ordinary packet filtering firewalls and stateful inspection firewalls only control traffic based on IP address or TCP/UDP port number, application-layer proxies like those included in the Firebox look deeper into the packet to make decisions on information such as URL or MIME content type (for an HTTP proxy, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this advantage also becomes a disadvantage as many application-layer proxies may not understand or be compatible with protocol-specific extensions. In this particular case, it&amp;rsquo;s the iDisk service provided by Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mac.com/&#34;&gt;.Mac&lt;/a&gt; subscription service. The iDisk service uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webdav.org/&#34;&gt;WebDAV&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification. It appears that, in general, most WebDAV services operate properly through the Fireboxs HTTP proxy (although some issues with Microsoft Exchange&amp;rsquo;s Outlook Web Access were reported with earlier versions of the WatchGuard Firebox System software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iDisk service, though, apparently uses some non-RFC-compliant headers (note that this was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; confirmed with a packet capture). As a result, the Proxied-HTTP service (which employs, as the name suggests, an application-layer HTTP proxy) prevents these headers from being passed and therefore prevents iDisk from working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make iDisk work from behind a WatchGuard Firebox firewall, one of several steps must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the Filtered-HTTP service, which does not employ an application-layer HTTP proxy and therefore would not interfere with iDisk or other WebDAV-based applications or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modify the default properties of the Proxied-HTTP service to allow unknown headers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Proxied-HTTP service also provides for content filtering and reporting, it is generally preferred to use the HTTP proxy instead of an ordinary HTTP packet filter. The first option is therefore not the ideal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the behavior of the Proxied-HTTP service is somewhat configurable. In order to make iDisk work with the HTTP proxy, the &amp;ldquo;Remove unknown headers&amp;rdquo; option must be unchecked in the configuration for the HTTP proxy. By unchecking the &amp;ldquo;Remove unknown headers&amp;rdquo; option, the Firebox will allow non-RFC-compliant HTTP headers to pass through the firewall, and iDisk will work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2005 22:46:37 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/08/ubuntu-510/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu 5.10&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;-based variant of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. After having installed and used Kubuntu, I decided to try Ubuntu, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnome.org/&#34;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;-based cousin. I downloaded the ISO image of the install CD last night and installed it today while reviewing HSRP configurations for an upcoming Cisco installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am equally as pleased with Ubuntu as with Kubuntu. I find that version 2.12 of GNOME, which ships with Ubuntu, is much better than the older versions of GNOME that I had used. In addition, the overall fit and finish of the distribution is very good, and I continue to enjoy using apt-get to update and upgrade packages on the system. As a matter of fact, the only downside to either distribution so far is that Kubuntu doesn&amp;rsquo;t include &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; by default (note that Firefox is included with Ubuntu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I currently have two older Compaq Armada E500 laptops that I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded with Linux&amp;mdash;one is running Kubuntu, and the other is running Ubuntu. Both work flawlessly, including full interoperability with my wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Mass Password Changes in Active Directory</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/08/mass-password-changes-in-active-directory/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2005 22:16:58 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/08/mass-password-changes-in-active-directory/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I had a need in a project to set the password for a large number of Active Directory accounts simultaneously. Here&amp;rsquo;s the solution I came up with for this particular need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this technique, you&amp;rsquo;ll need &lt;code&gt;ldifde&lt;/code&gt; (included with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; (included with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; and most Linux distributions; Win32 versions available on the Internet), a text editor with search and replace functionality (advanced geeks are free to use &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;dsmod&lt;/code&gt; (from the &lt;em&gt;Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, export the list of user accounts out of Active Directory using ldifde. The command will look something like this (I&amp;rsquo;ve line wrapped here, as indicated by a backslash, but this should all be on one line):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldifde -d &amp;quot;CN=Users,DC=company,DC=com&amp;quot; -r &amp;quot;(objectclass=user)&amp;quot; \  
-f c:\export-1.ldif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a file called &amp;ldquo;export-1.ldif&amp;rdquo;. Using &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, filter this file down to only the full distinguished names of the users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;less export-1.ldif | grep &#39;dn: &#39; &amp;gt; export-2.ldif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; on a Win32 system. Also, on a Win32 system you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use double quotes instead of single quotes in the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; command. This creates a file called &amp;ldquo;export-2.ldif&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load this file into the text editor and make the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove all occurrences of &amp;ldquo;dn: &amp;ldquo; (there is a space after the colon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a double quotation mark before CN= at the start of each line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a double quotation mark after =com at the end of each line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save this modified file as &amp;ldquo;export-3.ldif&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, pipe this file through to the &lt;code&gt;dsmod&lt;/code&gt; program to set passwords for all the users in the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type export-3.ldif | dsmod user -pwd newpass1 -mustchpwd yes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full help for the dsmod command line syntax is available using &lt;code&gt;dsmod /?&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dsmod user /?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; filename&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the above command to log the output of the &lt;code&gt;dsmod&lt;/code&gt; command to a file. You can then use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; to parse this file to ensure that the command was successful for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/06/watchguard-firebox-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/06/watchguard-firebox-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;A short while back, I posted an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/11/22/cisco-pix-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/&#34;&gt;Cisco PIX VPN and Active Directory integration&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to follow that article up with a version looking at integration between Active Directory and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.watchguard.com/&#34;&gt;WatchGuard&lt;/a&gt; Firebox VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the PIX-AD integration document, this article assumes that you have some basic knowledge of how to work with the WatchGuard Firebox series of firewalls. This article was written using version 6.2 of the WatchGuard Firebox System software and Windows Server 2003; other versions of either the firewall software or Windows should be similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Configuring the Firebox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to setup the Firebox. Use the Firebox software (Policy Manager, specifically) to perform the following configuration tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the server that is running IAS (or will be running IAS; see below) as a RADIUS server in the Authentication Servers dialog box (found on the Setup menu). Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to specify the server&amp;rsquo;s IP address, port number (the default of 1645 will be fine), and the shared secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instruct the firewall to use RADIUS by going to Setup &amp;gt; Firewall Authentication and selecting &amp;ldquo;RADIUS&amp;rdquo; as the authentication type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure the firewall&amp;rsquo;s Remote User VPN (on the Network menu) to use RADIUS by checking the &amp;ldquo;Use RADIUS to authenticate remote users&amp;rdquo; check box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, proceed with configuring PPTP-based remote user VPNs as usual. Be sure to add a rule allowing traffic to/from the pptp_users group; otherwise, VPN users will be subject to the same traffic restrictions as Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Configuring Internet Authentication Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything else, create a new global security group in Active Directory. Call it &amp;ldquo;pptp_users&amp;rdquo;, just like the name of the group on the Firebox. This is an important part of the glue that will bind the Firebox together with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If IAS is not already installed, install IAS using the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it has been installed, launch it from the Administrative Tools folder on the Start Menu and we&amp;rsquo;ll proceed with configuring it for authenticating VPN connections to the Firebox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to grant IAS permission to read dial-in properties from user accounts in Active Directory. To do this, right-click on the &amp;ldquo;Internet Authentication Service (Local)&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Register Server in Active Directory&amp;rdquo;. Select Yes (or OK) if prompted to confirm. Note that if IAS was already installed, it may have already been registered with Active Directory as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, we can now configure the Firebox as a RADIUS client. Right-click on RADIUS Clients and select New RADIUS Client. In the wizard, specify the IP address (or DNS name) of the Firebox&amp;rsquo;s trusted interface and the shared secret. Note that this shared secret is the same secret key specified when configuring the RADIUS server in the Firebox previously. RADIUS clients use this to authenticate to RADIUS servers, so make it a reasonably strong password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create a new remote access policy. Right-click on Remote Access Policies and select New Remote Access Policy. In the wizard, specify a name, select to create a custom policy, and then add the following conditions to the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAS-IP-Address: This will be the IP address of the Firebox&amp;rsquo;s trusted interface. This helps to ensure that this policy only applies to VPN requests from this firewall and not from any other RADIUS client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows-Groups: This should be the &amp;ldquo;pptp_users&amp;rdquo; security group created earlier. Any user that should be allowed to authenticate on a VPN connection will need to be a member of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this policy should grant access. On the next screen, select &amp;ldquo;Edit Profile&amp;rdquo; to edit the remote access profile. This is important because we&amp;rsquo;ll need to verify that the RADIUS server is passing the correct information to the Firebox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Advanced tab, remove all the attributes listed there (Service-Type and Framed-Protocol are there by default) and then add the Filter-Id attribute. To this attribute, add the string value &amp;ldquo;pptp_users&amp;rdquo;. Click OK to save these changes to the profile and then finish creating the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make this policy the first policy (using the Move Up/Move Down commands in the IAS console), add a user to the group created earlier, and then test your connection. Remote systems attempting to connect via PPTP should now be able to authenticate the VPN connection using their Active Directory usernames and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this entry to correct some errors pointed out in the comments. Thanks for the feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a few updates to this weblog over the last few days. Nothing major, just a few minor changes here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to showing excerpts only on the index page. Of course, the archives pages (both category archives as well as monthly archives) were already showing excerpts only. Note that RSS feeds are still showing the full content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full entry page (the &amp;ldquo;single page,&amp;rdquo; in WordPress parlance) now shows the sidebar as well. It seems to me that this makes navigation through the weblog a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned the link to automatically post an entry&amp;rsquo;s URL to &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;; this link only shows up when reading the full post.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Protecting OWA with Apache</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/03/protecting-owa-with-apache/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2005 00:21:54 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/03/protecting-owa-with-apache/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Outlook Web Access (OWA) is the web-based interface for accessing e-mail and other resources handled by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, OWA&amp;rsquo;s popularity also makes it the target of numerous worms and security exploits. As a result, many organizations seek to deploy OWA behind a reverse proxy that can help shield OWA from web-based attacks and exploits. In this posting, I&amp;rsquo;m going to share information to help build a reverse proxy using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/httpd/&#34;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a skeleton of an &lt;code&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to support Apache as a reverse proxy in front of OWA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80  
NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443  
ProxyRequests Off

&amp;lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443&amp;gt;  
ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.com  
ServerName webmail.domain.com  
DocumentRoot /var/www/webmail  
RequestHeader set Front-End-Https &amp;quot;On&amp;quot;  
ProxyRequests Off  
ProxyPreserveHost On  

SSLEngine On  
SSLCertificateFile conf/webmail-ssl-cert.pem

&amp;lt;Location /exchange&amp;gt;  
ProxyPass http://mail.domain.com/exchange  
ProxyPassReverse http://mail.domain.com/exchange  
SSLRequireSSL  
&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Location /exchweb&amp;gt;  
ProxyPass http://mail.domain.com/exchweb  
ProxyPassReverse http://mail.domain.com/exchweb  
SSLRequireSSL  
&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Location /public&amp;gt;  
ProxyPass http://mail.domain.com/public  
ProxyPassReverse http://mail.domain.com/public  
SSLRequireSSL  
&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key portions of this configuration are described below, along with some supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NameVirtualHost:&lt;/em&gt; The NameVirtualHost directive enables Apache to use name-based virtual hosts on the specified IP addresses and ports. The parameter to the NameVirtualHost directive must match one of the VirtualHost definitions, as shown in the sample configuration, or else the content will be served from the default virtual host (the first virtual host listed in the configuration). Note that if the Apache reverse proxy will not be using name-based virtual hosts (instead using IP address-based virtual hosts or running only a single server instance), then this directive is not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RequestHeader:&lt;/em&gt; This directive instructs Apache to add a header &amp;ldquo;Front-End-Https: On&amp;rdquo; to requests sent to the internal OWA server. This header is proprietary to OWA and forces OWA to build URLs using &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;rdquo; references instead of ordinary &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;rdquo; references. This directive is required in order to terminate the SSL tunnel at the reverse proxy and use clear-text HTTP between the reverse proxy and the internal OWA server. This directive requires the &lt;code&gt;mod_headers&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProxyPreserveHost:&lt;/em&gt; This directive configures Apache to pass the original host header, supplied by the client, to the server to which the request is being proxied. (This is instead of the host name supplied in the ProxyPass directive.) Again, this facilitates the construction of URLs with the correct hostname when accessing resources inside OWA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SSLCertificateFile:&lt;/em&gt; Apache expects the web server&amp;rsquo;s SSL certificate to be in PEM format. If the certificate&amp;rsquo;s key is encrypted, Apache will prompt upon startup for the passphrase to the key (this prevents any form of automated startup). It is considered a security best practice to keep the key in a separate file (using the SSLCertificateKeyFile directive) in encrypted form and supply the password upon the startup of Apache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this configuration in place, the following benefits are realized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name-based virtual hosts are supported. This allows other URLs to also be proxied through this same reverse proxy server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSL encryption is offloaded from the Exchange server to the reverse proxy server. Traffic from the reverse proxy server itself to the Exchange server is standard, unencrypted HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When used in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modsecurity.org/&#34;&gt;mod_security&lt;/a&gt; (another Apache module), OWA is protected against a very significant majority of all web-based attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Apache to serve as a reverse proxy for OWA is a cost-effective way to add another layer of security to an Exchange-based messaging infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Certificate Conversion Using OpenSSL</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/02/certificate-conversion-using-openssl/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2005 16:08:35 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/02/certificate-conversion-using-openssl/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my various adventures with replacing Windows-based servers with Linux servers, I have had need on several occasions to take an SSL certificate (generated using Microsoft Certificate Services) and make it available to a Linux-based server. In some cases, it was to be used by the SSL wrapper &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt;; in others, it was for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/httpd/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the certificate needed to be in the PEM (originally Privacy Enhanced Mail, now a standard for encoding certificates) format. Windows, on the other hand, typically uses the PFX (PKCS #12) format for storing certificates. To prepare certificates for use on Linux, the certificates must be converted to PEM format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hopes that this information might be useful to others, here&amp;rsquo;s a process for converting from PFX to PEM using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssl.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of only a few items, the process is identical on Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows &lt;sup&gt;2000&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2003&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These steps were confirmed using OpenSSL 0.9.7a on Red Hat Linux 9.0, using OpenSSL 0.9.6i on Mac OS X 10.2.8, and OpenSSL 0.9.7c on Windows Server 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the certificate is not already available in PFX format, use the Certificates MMC snap-in to export the certificate and the corresponding private key to a PFX file. Be sure to note the passphrase used to protect the PFX file; it will be needed later. If the certificate (and its corresponding private key) is already available in PFX format and the passphrase for the PFX file is known, proceed to step 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a terminal prompt, type &lt;code&gt;openssl pkcs12 -in _pfxfilename.pfx_ -out _tempfile.pem_&lt;/code&gt;. This will convert the PFX file to a PEM file. The OpenSSL toolkit will prompt for the import passphrase; this will be the passphrase specified in step 1. A PEM passphrase will also be needed; make note of the passphrase used here (it will be needed later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a text editor (such as vi on a Linux system, or Notepad on a Windows system), split the encrypted RSA private key and the certificate into two separate files. Remove all extra text, leaving only the text between the lines with the dashes. Make note of the filenames; they will be needed later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RSA key is currently encrypted; this will an automated launch for the application using the certificate. It will be necessary to decrypt the RSA private key. To decrypt the RSA private key, use the command &lt;code&gt;openssl rsa -in _encryptedkey_ -out _decryptedkey_&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;encryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the file containing the RSA private key, as separated in step 3, and &lt;em&gt;decryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the file that will contain the decrypted RSA private key). The OpenSSL toolkit will prompt for the RSA key passphrase; this will be the passphrase specified in step 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux or Mac OS X: To concatenate the decrypted RSA private key and the certificate into a single file, use the command &lt;code&gt;cat _decryptedkey certificatefile_ &amp;gt; _finalfile.pem_&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;decryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the decrypted RSA key produced in step 4 and &lt;em&gt;certificatefile&lt;/em&gt; is the file containing only the certificate, as produced in step 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Windows: To combine the decrypted RSA private key and the certificate into a single file, use the command &lt;code&gt;copy /b _decryptedkey_+_certificatefile_ _finalfile.pem_&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;decryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the decrypted RSA key produced in step 4 and &lt;em&gt;certificatefile&lt;/em&gt; is the file containing only the certificate, as produced in step 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the concatenated file (finalfile.pem from step 5) with a text editor to add a blank line between the decrypted RSA private key and the certificate, and a blank line after the end of the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the certificate is ready for use. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to guard the unencrypted private key with extreme caution; loss of this file can result in the compromise of your system. Note also that most applications require that the certificates be owned by root and readable only by root (&lt;code&gt;chown root:root&lt;/code&gt; to make them owned by root and &lt;code&gt;chmod 600&lt;/code&gt; to make them readable only by root).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Updating Kubuntu to KDE 3.5</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/updating-kubuntu-to-kde-35/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2005 21:52:39 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/updating-kubuntu-to-kde-35/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt; 5.10, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;-based variant of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, normally comes with KDE 3.4.3. With KDE 3.5.0 just recently released, however, I wanted to update Kubuntu to use the latest version of KDE. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I had to do to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde-35.php&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, I downloaded and added the appropriate GPG key. Once that was done, I used &amp;ldquo;apt-get update&amp;rdquo; to download the latest package information and &amp;ldquo;apt-get upgrade&amp;rdquo; to upgrade packages. That upgraded most of KDE, but there were a few packages that still refused to upgrade (they were reported by apt-get as &amp;ldquo;held back&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After poking around with apt-get for a while, I discovered that there was one missing file&amp;mdash;libgnokii2&amp;mdash;that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found in the apt-get sources. I manually reviewed the apt-get sources and finally found this package in the universe section of the main Ubuntu apt-get source. I edited /etc/apt/sources.list to enable the other sections, then manually installed the missing file with these commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get clean  
apt-get update  
apt-get install libgnokii2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then edited &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt; again to disable the other sources and upgraded the remainder of the KDE packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get clean  
apt-get update  
apt-get upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last round of apt-get removed a few obsolete packages and then updated the remainder of the KDE packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; way of doing things, but it seemed to be the only way to make it work as anticipated. If anyone has a better way, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>HTTP Proxies and Command-Line Utilities</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/http-proxies-and-command-line-utilities/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I locked down outbound HTTP traffic from my network. All outbound HTTP traffic must now pass through a caching HTTP proxy. (The proxy also performs some content filtering so that the kids don&amp;rsquo;t access stuff they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent experiments with &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, I needed to download some small files using wget, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t because of the proxy. As it turns out, there is a really simple fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply set an environment variable called http_proxy to the correct URL of the outbound proxy server, e.g., &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://proxy.company.com:8080&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://proxy.company.com:8080&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or whatever. In the bash shell, this can be easily accomplished with this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export http_proxy=&amp;quot;http://proxy.domain.com:8080&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this environment variable was set properly (I messed up a couple of times trying to set it, getting my bash syntax confused with my tcsh syntax), wget and apt-get worked like a charm. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet tried this with yum on Fedora Core 3, but I anticipate that it will work there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;After wrestling with installing, configuring, and supporting Fedora Core 3 on an older Compaq Armada E500 laptop, I decided to break with my Red Hat/Fedora legacy and try &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; variation. Ubuntu itself is a relative newcomer to the Linux distribution arena, based on (as I understand it) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous stints using Linux as my desktop OS, I&amp;rsquo;d always been partial to KDE instead of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnome.org/&#34;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;. Some would say that it&amp;rsquo;s because KDE has traditionally been more &amp;ldquo;Windows-like&amp;rdquo; than the other Linux graphical environments; perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the case. I&amp;rsquo;ve typically found KDE easier to work with, and since this laptop would eventually be used by the kids I felt like ease of use was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install went very quickly and very smoothly. When the install was done, I then proceeded to update KDE to version 3.5.0 (which had just been released a few days before). Along the way, I learned a handy piece of information about HTTP proxies and command-line utilities (I&amp;rsquo;ll soon post information on that as well). Eventually, I managed to get apt-get to download and install the updated KDE 3.5 packages. I rebooted the system and found that I was now running the updated version of KDE. (Side note: There are still some KDE packages that won&amp;rsquo;t upgrade for some reason; I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on resolving that issue.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still too early to tell for certain, but I may just have found a new desktop Linux version.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Secure Remote Filesystem</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/29/secure-remote-filesystem/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/29/secure-remote-filesystem/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something that only a computer junkie could enjoy. In conjunction with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;FUSE&lt;/a&gt; project (now an official part of the Linux kernel as of version 2.6.14), an SSH-wrapped remote filesystems&amp;ndash;called &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html&#34;&gt;sshfs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;has been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/11/176206&#34;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; describes sshfs in a bit more detail and provides some additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? It means that for any remote system you can reach via SSH, you can mount that remote system&amp;rsquo;s filesystem inside an SSH tunnel. I can think of numerous possibilities, not the least of which involves easily updating a web site hosted on a remote web server without having to FTP (or SFTP) the files back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if only there was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; version of sshfs&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s currently only available for Linux and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Not suprisingly, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s moves to &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; up its XML-based file formats for current and future versions of Microsoft Office have swayed the State of Massachusetts back to its side again.

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/29/microsoft-promises-not-to-sue/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; recently made a move to &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; up its XML-based file formats for Microsoft Office 2003 and the forthcoming Office 12. These file formats were offered to ECMA International for consideration as a formal open standard. However, the &amp;ldquo;license&amp;rdquo; for these file formats was merely a promise not to sue people violating its patents on the use of the file formats. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1894039,00.asp&#34;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1892757,00.asp&#34;&gt;these comments&lt;/a&gt; from a legal analyst regarding Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/covenant.mspx&#34;&gt;Patent Protection Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, a promise &amp;ldquo;not to sue&amp;rdquo; from any large corporation&amp;ndash;not just Microsoft&amp;ndash;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be good enough for me were I a developer. Somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that many developers are going to feel completely comfortable incorporating Office &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; XML-based file formats into their applications based solely on the Patent Protection Covenant. What happens when (not if) the covenant changes?&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my posting &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/11/21/zero-day-ie-exploit/&#34;&gt;Zero-Day IE Exploit&lt;/a&gt;, it has now been discovered that this exploit is no longer just a denial of service (DoS) flaw, but rather a flaw that can allow remote code execution (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.security.ithub.com/article/Unpatched+IE+Flaw+Is+Worse+Than+Expected/166164_1.aspx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information). As of this writing, there is no patch for this vulnerability and the only workaround is to disable Active Scripting in IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q154036/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a Microsoft KB article that describes how to disable Active Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, you can just switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; (which, by the way, is supposed to release Firefox 1.5 sometime today).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>ipfw Rules for Bonjour</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/28/ipfw-rules-for-bonjour/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2005 16:11:38 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/28/ipfw-rules-for-bonjour/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally published this information on my business website, but thought I&amp;rsquo;d reproduce it here in the event someone needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/&#34;&gt;Bonjour&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Rendezvous) auto-discovery service is used in a number of Apple-branded products as well as a growing number of third-party applications (for example, my HP Color LaserJet 2550N supports Bonjour). It&amp;rsquo;s used to advertise and discover &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; music libraries, and Apple&amp;rsquo;s Airport Admin Utility also uses Bonjour to discover &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/&#34;&gt;Airport Extreme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/&#34;&gt;Airport Express&lt;/a&gt; wireless base stations for configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonjour uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.multicastdns.org/&#34;&gt;multicast DNS&lt;/a&gt; (known as mDNS), part of the IETF standard known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeroconf.org/&#34;&gt;Zeroconf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is well and good, but if you are using the built-in firewall you most likely are preventing Bonjour from working correctly. I grew frustrated trying to utilize Bonjour-related services while also keeping my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; protected against unwanted network traffic. Using a packet sniffer and Brian Hill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/brickhouse.html&#34;&gt;Brickhouse&lt;/a&gt; application, I observed Bonjour traffic and created a set of ipfw rules that can be used to allow this traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multicast DNS operates over UDP (IP protocol 17) with a destination port 5353 and a source port above 1024. The destination address is, of course, a multicast address (in the 224.0.0.0 range). Responses to mDNS multicasts originate from UDP port 5353, but are bound for a random high port above 1024. Simply defining a rule that allows traffic to and from UDP port 5353 wont work, because while outbound traffic will be correctly matched the responses to those outbound requests wont be matched and will be dropped (assuming the default action is to deny traffic). So, a sample rule to be added to ipfw might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add 2008 allow udp from 10.1.1.0/24 5353 to any 1024-65535 in via en0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This should be entered all on a single line.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule allows traffic from the source network 10.1.1.0 (the &amp;ldquo;/24&amp;rdquo; indicating a 24-bit mask, i.e., a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0) from UDP source port 5353 to any port above 1024 on any destination address inbound via the en0 interface. The en0 interface is typically the built-in Ethernet interface on most &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;-based systems. (Likewise, en1 is typically the built-in AirPort/AirPort Extreme wireless interface.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are tightly restricting outbound traffic as well, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a matching outbound rule (of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own experience has shown that adding this rule to my ipfw ruleset has allowed Bonjour to work as expected without sacrificing the security of my system.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Making Backup DVD Copies</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/27/making-backup-dvd-copies/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2005 20:23:16 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/27/making-backup-dvd-copies/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I love DVDs. Ever since I bought my surround sound system around Christmas of 2000, I have preferred DVDs over VHS for any new movies that we purchase. The big problem, though, is that DVDs aren&amp;rsquo;t nearly as durable as videotapes, and in a family with kids that&amp;rsquo;s a big deal. I have younger kids, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much for a kid to scratch a DVD when putting it into or taking it out of the DVD player. All it takes is one scratch and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the end of that movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before I switched to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, I have been making digital copies of every CD that I purchase, so that I can quickly and easily make another copy in the event that the original CD gets damaged in any way. The introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&#34;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; have made this easier. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered, even with the introduction of the 5th generation iPod with video capabilities, that I could do the same with my DVDs until just the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I set out to see if it was possible to do the same with my DVDs. I&amp;rsquo;d researched this a little bit earlier, so I already knew about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.losprimates.net/mtr/&#34;&gt;MacTheRipper&lt;/a&gt; (MTR), a program for extracting the digital video from a DVD. I used MTR to extract the video for &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt; to an external FireWire hard drive attached to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;. That process went well, didn&amp;rsquo;t take too terribly long, and the resulting VIDEO_TS folder created by MTR worked flawlessly using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&#34;&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt;. I then turned to a program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://lonestar.utsa.edu/llee/applescript/dvdimager.html&#34;&gt;DVD Imager&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to turn a VIDEO_TS folder into a DVD image that can be burned to a DVD. The problem, however, was that the VIDEO_TS folder and the resulting DVD image were 6.87GB in size. As a result, I was not able to burn the image back to a standard DVD-R using my PowerBook&amp;rsquo;s SuperDrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried another DVD (&lt;em&gt;Robots&lt;/em&gt; this time) and ended up with 4.62GB of data. OK, I thought, a single-layer DVD holds 4.7GB of data so I should be fine. Wrong! That didn&amp;rsquo;t work, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means I&amp;rsquo;m currently stumped as to the next step. A number of online searches have turned up recommendations for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.roxio.com/en/products/popcorn/&#34;&gt;Popcorn&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.roxio.com/&#34;&gt;Roxio&lt;/a&gt;), but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to see if I can avoid having to purchase software and instead make do with freeware and/or open source applications.&lt;/p&gt;

          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/22/cisco-pix-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2005 19:01:54 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/22/cisco-pix-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;Rather than publishing this information in PDF form on my business website, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try something new and post it here as a blog entry. So, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This information assumes that you have some experience with the Cisco PIX firewall (i.e., you know how to enter configuration commands and have a basic idea of what the configuration commands actually do) as well as some experience with Windows and Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that information in hand, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Configuring the Cisco PIX&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to setup the PIX firewall. Use the commands below to configure the PIX for PPTP-based VPN connections that will authenticate against an Active Directory back-end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ip local pool vpn-pool 10.10.10.1-10.10.10.254  
aaa-server vpn-auth inside host 10.10.10.5 secretkey  
aaa-server vpn-auth inside host 10.10.10.6 secretkey  
aaa-server vpn-auth protocol radius  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group accept dialin pptp  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group ppp authentication mschap  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group ppp encryption mppe 128 required  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group client configuration \  
address local vpn-pool  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group client configuration \  
dns 10.10.10.5 10.10.10.6  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group client configuration \  
wins 10.10.10.6 10.10.10.5  
vpdn group vpn-pptp-group client authentication aaa vpn-auth  
vpdn enable outside  
sysopt connect permit-pptp  
access-list acl-nat0 permit ip 10.10.1.0 255.255.255.0 \  
10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0  
nat (inside) 0 access-list acl-nat0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that I have placed a backslash to indicate text that is wrapped onto two lines here but should be entered all on a single line in the PIX configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this configuration, replace the IP addresses on lines 2 and 3 (the &lt;code&gt;aaa-server vpn-auth&lt;/code&gt; commands) with the IP addresses of the servers running Internet Authentication Service (IAS) on Windows. See the next section for more information on configuring IAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On those same lines, replace the text &lt;code&gt;secretkey&lt;/code&gt; with the RADIUS shared secret that will be used when configuring the RADIUS/IAS server in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, replace the IP addresses on lines 9 and 10 (the &lt;code&gt;vdpn group vpn-pptp-group client configuration&lt;/code&gt; lines that pass out the DNS and WINS servers to VPN clients) with the IP addresses of your DNS and WINS servers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should do it. Save the configuration to the PIX and then move on to configuring IAS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Configuring Internet Authentication Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything else, create a new global security group in Active Directory. Call it something like &amp;ldquo;VPN Users&amp;rdquo; or similar. We&amp;rsquo;ll use this group later as an additional security check in validating VPN connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, install IAS using the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel. Once it has been installed, launch it from the Administrative Tools folder on the Start Menu and we&amp;rsquo;ll proceed with configuring it for authenticating VPN connections to the PIX firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to grant IAS permission to read dial-in properties from user accounts in Active Directory. To do this, right-click on the &amp;ldquo;Internet Authentication Service (Local)&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Register Server in Active Directory&amp;rdquo;. Select Yes (or OK) if prompted to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, we can now configure the PIX firewall as a RADIUS client. Right-click on RADIUS Clients and select New RADIUS Client. In the wizard, specify the IP address (or DNS name) of the PIX firewall&amp;rsquo;s internal IP address and the shared secret. Note that this shared secret is the same secret key specified in the PIX configuration above. RADIUS clients use this to authenticate to RADIUS servers, so make it a reasonably strong password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create a remote access policy. Right-click on Remote Access Policies and select New Remote Access Policy. In the wizard, specify a name, select to create a custom policy, and then add the following conditions to the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAS-IP-Address: This will be the IP address of the PIX firewall&amp;rsquo;s internal interface. This helps to ensure that this policy only applies to VPN requests from this firewall and not from any other RADIUS client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows-Groups: This should be the security group created earlier. Any user that should be allowed to authenticate on a VPN connection will need to be a member of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the policy should be very straightforward. Make this policy the first policy (using the Move Up/Move Down commands in the IAS console), add a user to the group created earlier, and then test your connection. Remote systems attempting to connect via PPTP should now be able to authenticate the VPN connection using their Active Directory usernames and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this was written from the perspective of authenticating PPTP connections, the process should be very similar for IPSec VPN clients as well.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Another Take on Life(song)</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/22/another-take-on-lifesong/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2005 12:57:33 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/22/another-take-on-lifesong/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/09/25/lifesong-by-casting-crowns/&#34;&gt;earlier posting&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;Lifesong&lt;/em&gt;, the second CD by the Christian group &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castingcrowns.org/home.php&#34;&gt;Casting Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke primarily about their musical style and their sound. At the time, I was so wrapped up in how the music sounded in comparison with their debut album that I was disappointed in this latest effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued listening to the CD, concentrating mostly on the tracks that I really enjoyed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Lifesong&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Praise You in This Storm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Set Me Free&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Father, Spirit, Jesus&amp;rdquo;. As I listened&amp;mdash;truly listened&amp;mdash;to the words of these songs, and then took the time to listen to the other songs on the album as well, I realized that I was guilty of the very things that Casting Crowns sings about in these songs. And my first review was the perfect indicator of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people practice Christianity on the surface. Sure, they go to church. They may even teach Sunday School, or lead a Bible study group. But do they really serve the Lord? Is their service&amp;mdash;my service&amp;mdash;just &amp;ldquo;empty hands held high&amp;rdquo;? How often do we high our true feelings from others, even our fellow Christians, becoming &amp;ldquo;happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples&amp;rdquo;? Can we see past that young unwed mother&amp;rsquo;s sin, see &amp;ldquo;past her scarlet letter&amp;rdquo; and actually get to know her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry isn&amp;rsquo;t just about a CD, though; that&amp;rsquo;s why I titled this post &amp;ldquo;Another Take on Life(song)&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about &lt;em&gt;Lifesong&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s time for us&amp;mdash;for me&amp;mdash;to move past superficial Christianity and into true service for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean full-time ministry, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean just going to church. It means serving the Lord with all that we are and in all that we do (and my use of the term &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; here includes myself). It means living a life that &amp;ldquo;brings a smile&amp;rdquo; to the Lord, where we take to heart Jesus&amp;rsquo; teachings and actually apply them in all areas of life, not just the areas that are convenient or comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means letting our life(song) sing to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Microsoft&#39;s Counter-Move</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/21/microsofts-counter-move/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The rallying cry around OpenDocument prompted Microsoft to make its counter-move. As fully expected, Microsoft is trying to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1891829,00.asp&#34;&gt;create a standard&lt;/a&gt; based on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own (until now) proprietary XML formats. Please tell me you saw this coming, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With companies from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/&#34;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corel.com/&#34;&gt;Corel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1877815,00.asp&#34;&gt;standing in support&lt;/a&gt; of the OpenDocument format, a new coalition forming in support of the format, and governments agencies such as the State of Massachusetts requiring the use of file formats such as PDF and OpenDocument, clearly Microsoft was worried. Otherwise, why try to create an alternate standard of your own creation? Why not just join the existing standards? Many are also saying that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s decision to include PDF support in the next version of Office is another attempt to keep from being shut out. After all, Office is a major cash cow for Microsoft, so the company will do whatever it can to provent a loss of marketshare (and revenue as a result).&lt;/p&gt;

(Apparently, only Windows Server 2003 with the Enhanced Security Configuration is immune.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No patch has been released, and no security advisory had been posted at the time this was written. A Microsoft security advisory was expected at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. No, really&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft has posted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/911302.mspx&#34;&gt;security advisory&lt;/a&gt; about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This new blog is just about ready for public consumption. I just finished configuring the permalink structure so that all posts have a static URL, using a pretty common structure that includes the date of the post in the URL. (This seems to be a reasonably well-accepted practice.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the static URLs for permalinks also come static URLs for category archives and feeds. Unfortunately, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back and rework any internal links I created in my own posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I reworked the template to include a hyperlink for adding a post&amp;rsquo;s URL to your &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmarks. Now you can add an entry to your bookmark list with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Sony Keeps Digging Itself Deeper</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/10/sony-keeps-digging-itself-deeper/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2005 19:00:21 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/10/sony-keeps-digging-itself-deeper/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The furor over the rootkit technology used by Sony in their DRM software continues to grow. After Mark Russinovich &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html&#34;&gt;unveiled the truth&lt;/a&gt;, Sony released a patch that supposedly allows for the DRM technology to be uninstalled. Of course, Mark &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/more-on-sony-dangerous-decloaking.html&#34;&gt;reviewed the uninstallation&lt;/a&gt;, and he found it left a little bit to be desired (putting it mildly). Basically, it left you at risk of a blue screen of death. And Mark&amp;rsquo;s not the only one not satisfied&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1883820,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; cites several other security experts as well who are not happy with this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, First 4 Internet (the company behind the cloaking technology that Sony uses for their DRM software) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sonys-rootkit-first-4-internet.html&#34;&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt; to Mark&amp;rsquo;s posts and attempts to refute his findings. Finally, today, Mark posted more details on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sony-you-dont-reeeeaaaally-want-to_09.html&#34;&gt;actual uninstallation process&lt;/a&gt; and what is required in order to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony just keeps digging itself deeper and deeper into this hole. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that the company uses stealth/cloaking technologies to hide their files. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough by itself that the DRM software is communicating back to Sony whenever a CD is played. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that the uninstallation process requires so many steps and is so complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make matters worse&amp;hellip;check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://entmag.com/news/article.asp?editorialsid=7033&#34;&gt;this news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it all together, and you get a mistake so massive that it could change Sony&amp;rsquo;s business fortunes. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; going to buy any Sony CDs or software now, after everything that&amp;rsquo;s been disclosed? I&amp;rsquo;m not, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. (Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have to worry about it that much since I&amp;rsquo;m using a Mac and not Windows, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different story for a different day.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A pair of recent articles (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880142,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/03/2255215&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; at NewsForge) have me a bit perplexed. What&amp;rsquo;s the real value of MapFS? I know I have to be missing something here. Somebody send me an e-mail and explain it to me, or give me an example (other than the Live CD example mentioned in one of the articles above) of how this could be used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>It Was Bound to Happen</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/09/it-was-bound-to-happen/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2005 16:17:25 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/09/it-was-bound-to-happen/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, I agree with the belief that operating systems and applications that don&amp;rsquo;t have a significant market share like Windows, IIS, and Exchange won&amp;rsquo;t get targeted as frequently and therefore will have a &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; security track record. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason that Linux, Mac OS X, and others haven&amp;rsquo;t seen as many security vulnerabilities and the oh-so-fun network worms that invariably accompany them. But I will agree that as these alternatives gain in popularity, more hackers are going to target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1882889,00.asp&#34;&gt;new Linux worm&lt;/a&gt; has recently emerged. I mean, it was bound to happen. Linux is surging in popularity, as Linus Torvalds and other developers continue to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1881470,00.asp&#34;&gt;add features&lt;/a&gt; to the Linux kernel and more and more corporations deploy Linux. Of course the malware authors are going to try something like this. I doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me in the least. While this one is fairly low-tech, you can bet that future variants of this worm (as well as new worms) will be more complex and more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also fully expect that the anti-Linux crowd will shout that this is the end of the line for Linux, just like the anti-Microsoft crowd shouts &amp;ldquo;Down with Windows!&amp;rdquo; everytime Microsoft patches a critical security flaw that could be exploited by an automated worm (side note: new Microsoft critical security flaw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-053.mspx&#34;&gt;patched yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, go have a look and make sure you are protected). This just isn&amp;rsquo;t the case. Neither Windows nor Linux are going to go away, and each of them has value for businesses today. The best bet for any organization is to use the product that best fits the need and then make sure that the product is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;properly &lt;em&gt;configured&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;properly &lt;em&gt;patched&lt;/em&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;properly &lt;em&gt;maintained&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these guidelines, businesses and consumers can safely deploy the products, technologies, and platforms that best meet their needs without falling prey to technology bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Current Tech Projects</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/06/current-tech-projects/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2005 14:19:15 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/06/current-tech-projects/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, I like to post out here a list of my current &amp;ldquo;tech projects.&amp;rdquo; These are the things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on for my own network, things that I may or may not start recommending to or supporting for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my current list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterNetNews (INN): I had an installation of INN up and running a short while back, but had to resort to an ugly hack with stunnel in order to make SSL work from a newsreader. To get a clean build, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;ll just start from scratch with a clean installation. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; 4.1 again as I work on transitioning all my Linux-based servers to a newer Linux distribution, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be compiling INN from source instead of using a package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;-based antispam gateway: I&amp;rsquo;ve got an antispam gateway running right now (uses Red Hat Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt; 2.1, SpamAssassin, Postgrey, Razor, DCC, and ClamAV), but I want to try building one using OpenBSD 3.8 (just recently released) and newer builds of Postfix, SpamAssassin, and Amavisd-New. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the advanced integration of newer versions of Postfix and Amavisd-New.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;XC Connect: I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned XC Connect before as well, but a previous installation proved to be unstable, and the Apache integration was less than stellar. In fact, the integration was nonexistent. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try a clean build of CentOS 4.1 and XC Connect to see if that will correct the stability and integration problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to wrap up the documentation for a few completed items, such as the Cisco VPN integration with Active Directory. Mac OS X integration with Active Directory is also on the &amp;ldquo;to do&amp;rdquo; list, but it will have to wait a little while&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll need to find another Mac to &amp;ldquo;experiment&amp;rdquo; with instead of using my own PowerBook.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>OpenBSD pcn0 Driver Issue Resolved</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/04/openbsd-pcn0-driver-issue-resolved/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2005 08:48:20 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/04/openbsd-pcn0-driver-issue-resolved/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, sort of resolved. I was never able to make the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; 3.8) actually work under &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, but I did find information on how to disable the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver and revert to the older &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2005-08/1314.html&#34;&gt;archived Neohapsis discussion&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a quick e-mail exchange with the author of the thread (who, thankfully, was very responsive and very helpful) led me to the solution. Some of it I had to improvise on the fly, but here&amp;rsquo;s the overall process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boot from the OpenBSD 3.8 boot CD image (I pointed the virtual CD-ROM drive in the VM directly to the corresponding ISO image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the OpenBSD &amp;ldquo;boot&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; prompt, type &amp;ldquo;-c&amp;rdquo; and press Enter. This takes you into User Kernel Config, or UKC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the UKC prompt, type &amp;ldquo;disable pcn&amp;rdquo; to disable the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &amp;ldquo;quit&amp;rdquo; at the next UKC prompt to exit the kernel config and proceed with the boot process. If you watch the boot process, you will see OpenBSD load the &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver and identify the virtual NIC as &lt;code&gt;le1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all well and good, but how do you make the changes stick between reboots? Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten OpenBSD fully installed and are rebooting for the first time after installation, follow the steps above to use the &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver for the next reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &amp;ldquo;config -e -o nbsd bsd&amp;rdquo; command (see the relevant &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=config&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;sektion=0&amp;amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.8&amp;amp;arch=i386&amp;amp;format=html&#34;&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt; for details) to modify the kernel again, only this time saving the changes to the file named &amp;ldquo;nbsd&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon the next reboot after using the config command to create a new kernel file, specify the name of that new kernel file (&amp;ldquo;nbsd&amp;rdquo; in our example here) at the OpenBSD &amp;ldquo;boot&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that everything works OK (it did for me), rename the original kernel to &amp;ldquo;bsd.original&amp;rdquo; and rename your new kernel to just &amp;ldquo;bsd&amp;rdquo;. Then, upon the next reboot, the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver should be disabled and everything should work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this process, I now have two OpenBSD 3.8 VMs running and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues. Now, on to installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clamav.net/&#34;&gt;ClamAV&lt;/a&gt; on OpenBSD&amp;hellip;.&lt;em&gt;(more details soon)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;pcn0&lt;/code&gt; network driver from OpenBSD 3.9 works perfectly under VMware (at least, on ESX Server). I have posted more information &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2006/05/18/openbsd-39-on-esx-server/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Rootkit Technology in Sony DRM</title>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/rootkit-technology-in-sony-drm/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html&#34;&gt;very in-depth article&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Russinovich unveiled that DRM technology shipping with recent Sony BMG CDs actually installs &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit&#34;&gt;rootkit&lt;/a&gt; components onto your system. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of a vendor &lt;em&gt;unknowingly&lt;/em&gt; installing software on my computer(s) that contain rootkit components&amp;ndash;especially when those rootkit components could be used by malicious software packages to hide themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see that &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880543,00.asp&#34;&gt;picked up the story&lt;/a&gt; as well. (Note that O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s ONLamp.net is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8269?CMP=OTC-6YE827253101&#34;&gt;mentioning it&lt;/a&gt; as well.) Mark&amp;rsquo;s research is fantastic (as always), but not many people will get exposed to this news through him alone. Computer geeks like myself would, of course, but the people that really need to know this are the non-geeks. Any reasonably computer-savvy user is likely to want to pick up your average CD (from any number of distribution channels, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;) and copy the music off the CD. There are a number of very valid reasons for this&amp;ndash;ease of access, personal backup copy (ever scratch a CD?), etc. Copy-protected CDs limit your ability to do this without also installing stealthy rootkit components onto your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More links to other discussions on this topic can be found in section 8 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit&#34;&gt;this Wikipedia rootkit article&lt;/a&gt; (also linked above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is just plain wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s wrong to install this kind of software onto someone&amp;rsquo;s system. I can understand their desire to want to protect their &amp;ldquo;intellectual property,&amp;rdquo; but there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way than installing rootkits on your customers&amp;rsquo; computers.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Small OpenBSD 3.8 Speed Bump</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/small-openbsd-38-speed-bump/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2005 19:09:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/small-openbsd-38-speed-bump/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;My attempts to deploy the latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, version 3.8 (released yesterday), have run into what I hope is only a small speed bump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous versions of OpenBSD (I first started using OpenBSD only a couple of versions ago, with the release of OpenBSD 3.6), the AMD PCnet adapter that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; presents to virtual machines was detected using the &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver. So, the virtual network adapter in a VM running OpenBSD 3.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.7 (and earlier versions, presumably) would be &lt;code&gt;le1&lt;/code&gt;. With the release of OpenBSD 3.8, the driver has changed to &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; (making the virtual network adapter &lt;code&gt;pcn0&lt;/code&gt;), and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work&amp;mdash;at all. Several attempts last night failed miserably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is hope on the horizon. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search turned up an &lt;a href=&#34;http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2005-08/1314.html&#34;&gt;archived Neohapsis discussion&lt;/a&gt; that raises the possibility of disabling the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver and using &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; instead. I hope to try that in the next couple of days to see how it works, and I&amp;rsquo;ll post the results here.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>LSB Recognized by ISO</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/01/lsb-recognized-by-iso/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2005 19:12:19 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/01/lsb-recognized-by-iso/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880214,00.asp&#34;&gt;News surfaced today&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iso.org/iso/en/ISOOnline.frontpage&#34;&gt;International Organization for Standardization&lt;/a&gt; (ISO) has approved the Linux Standards Base (LSB) as an international standard. The LSB 2.0.1 core specification has been accepted by the ISO and will be published as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=41481&amp;amp;scopelist=PROGRAMME&#34;&gt;International Standard 23360&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, this is a big indicator of Linux&amp;rsquo;s maturity. Does Linux still need growth in some areas to be more competitive with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/netware/&#34;&gt;Novell NetWare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/&#34;&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, certainly. And yet, at the same time, Linux has strengths all its own as well. This recognition by the ISO of the Linux Standards Base serves to further legitimize Linux as a viable and worthy competitor to the proprietary operating systems listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, you&amp;rsquo;ll note that I did not include Novell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/products/openenterpriseserver/&#34;&gt;Open Enterprise Server&lt;/a&gt; in the list of operating systems above because it is, of course, based on Linux.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting articles here for this long, but it&amp;rsquo;s time for another release of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;. As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned here before, I do use OpenBSD for a few purposes on my network, and I&amp;rsquo;m confident that OpenBSD 3.8, due November 1, will find its way onto the network as well. (It&amp;rsquo;s fairly likely it will quickly replace OpenBSD 3.7.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know you are a true geek when you start measuring time in OpenBSD releases (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this for over 8 OpenBSD releases!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the OpenBSD web site has more information on ordering CD-ROMs or T-shirts to help support the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like using Unix-like operating systems (like Linux), then you should try OpenBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,105623,00.html&#34;&gt;This story&lt;/a&gt; about the University of Indianapolis and their home-grown system for quarantining PCs infected by spyware or viruses is really interesting. Named &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelob&#34;&gt;Shelob&lt;/a&gt; (and soon to be renamed &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungoliant&#34;&gt;Ungoliant&lt;/a&gt; to prevent a conflict with another open source project), this system &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; works. Today. How is it, then, that a group of IT staffers at a university can come up with a system for network access control, but multi-million dollar companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t? I could say that this is a testament to the value of open source software, upon which the solution is built, but that seems fairly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

Even better, they run Windows, Linux, or Solaris (all fully supported by Sun, too). It&amp;rsquo;s almost like having your cake and eating it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Technology Convergence</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/19/technology-convergence/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2005 15:37:16 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for someone to take revolutionary (in my opinion, at least) technologies such as virtualization, blade servers (or any alternative server form factors), and thin-client access and combine them. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibm.com/&#34;&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citrix.com/&#34;&gt;Citrix&lt;/a&gt; are doing, as discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1873113,00.asp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging their individual strengths (IBM&amp;rsquo;s hardware, VMware&amp;rsquo;s virtualization, and Citrix&amp;rsquo;s access technologies), the group is rolling out a hosted client infrastructure that will compete directly with so-called &amp;ldquo;blade PCs&amp;rdquo; (from companies such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clearcube.com/controller/home.php&#34;&gt;ClearCube&lt;/a&gt;) and traditional thin clients (from companies such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wyse.com/index.htm&#34;&gt;Wyse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.neoware.com/&#34;&gt;Neoware&lt;/a&gt;). The nice thing about this solution is that it works equally well with full PCs and thin client devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good stuff. IBM&amp;rsquo;s blade servers are well-respected, and IBM&amp;rsquo;s integration of their blades with technologies from Cisco Systems (such as their Cisco Systems Intelligent Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module for the IBM eServer BladeCenter, more information available &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=8712463&amp;amp;storeId=1&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;catalogId=-840&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) gives them a leg up on the competitors. As for virtualization&amp;hellip;well, VMware invented the market, and while &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; may be offering a virtualization product of its own they have a long way to go to catch up. VMware&amp;rsquo;s latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/esx/&#34;&gt;ESX Server&lt;/a&gt;  offers much-improved resource utilization and scheduling functionality, particularly when used in combination with the latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/vc/&#34;&gt;VirtualCenter&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, Citrix pioneered multi-user Windows and the ICA protocol, and they continue to innovate in recent versions of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=186&amp;amp;ntref=hp_nav_US&#34;&gt;Presentation Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining these technologies to create a dynamic environment where users are seamlessly connected to virtual servers hosted on and across multiple blade servers is a natural evolution for each of these technologies. (I would guess that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to point out how full circle this brings enterprise computing environments.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Protecting Against OpenSSL SSLv2 Flaw</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/18/protecting-against-openssl-sslv2-flaw/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2005 14:42:43 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/18/protecting-against-openssl-sslv2-flaw/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20051011.txt&#34;&gt;recent flaw&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssl.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; (versions prior to 0.9.7h and 0.9.8a) highlights the fact that SSL is not a security panacea. (You can get more information about this flaw from the link above, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1870003,00.asp&#34;&gt;this &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, or from &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/10/11/openssl_patches_security_hole.html&#34;&gt;this Netcraft post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disabling the SSL v2 protocol entirely is another way to protect against this flaw. Since OpenSSL is a set of libraries that other applications use to add SSL/TLS functionality, though, that configuration occurs within the specific applications, not within OpenSSL itself. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to protect &lt;a href=&#34;http://httpd.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; by disabling SSL v2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable SSL v2 support within Apache 2.0 with mod_ssl, use the following directive in the Apache configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SSLProtocol +All -SSLv2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables SSLv3 and TLSv1, but disables SSLv2. (Also see this Apache httpd &lt;a href=&#34;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslprotocol&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched for but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a similar workaround for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt;. The smtpd_tls_cipherlist and smtp_tls_cipherlist directives allow you to specify the supported ciphers and refer you to the OpenSSL documentation. However, the OpenSSL documentation didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to indicate a clear way of disabling only SSL v2. There did appear to be some discussion of adding this functionality in Postfix 2.3. If anyone knows of the particular keywords to specify with the smtpd_tls_cipherlist and smtp_tls_cipherlist commands for Postfix (or knows of any other way to disable SSL v2 support in Postfix), please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/08/bluetooth-interfering-with-gprs-on-my-treo-650/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I noticed while using my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/&#34;&gt;Treo 650&lt;/a&gt; that I could not perform a HotSync operation via &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth&#34;&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; while I had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS&#34;&gt;GPRS&lt;/a&gt; connection active. As if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered what appears to be a further incompatibility between these two wireless technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears as if anytime I use Bluetooth on the Treo 650 for anything other than communicating with my wireless headset (a &lt;a href=&#34;http://motorola.digitalriver.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&amp;amp;SiteID=motostor&amp;amp;Locale=en_US&amp;amp;Env=BASE&amp;amp;productID=36061500&#34;&gt;Motorola HS850&lt;/a&gt;), I am unable to establish a GPRS connection. I get an error (the exact text varies) whenever I try to establish the GPRS connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed all the various settings on the Treo, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything that needs to be changed to fix this. This is terribly irritating, since I&amp;rsquo;d really like to be able to wirelessly HotSync my Treo to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; while I am away from the office without having to give up my data access via GPRS.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Just in Case</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/08/just-in-case/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2005 17:58:09 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/08/just-in-case/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the bug discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;905809&#34;&gt;KB905809&lt;/a&gt; several times in this blog. In reading those posts (or reading the KB article), you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen that you can use the SC.EXE command to set the security descriptors on the Service Control Manager to fix the bug. What happens, though, if you mess up the SC.EXE command?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this very thing happened recently. A systems administrator copied the required SC.EXE command line from a Word document, thinking it was safer to copy and paste than try to type the command line directly. As it turns out, the copied text from Word had a carriage return in it, and this caused the command line to terminate early (before all the security descriptors were applied). In fact, what happened is that all of the &amp;ldquo;Write&amp;rdquo; permissions were removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &amp;ldquo;sc sdshow scmanager&amp;rdquo; on a system running Windows Server 2003 SP1, you&amp;rsquo;ll get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;D:(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)  
(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA)S:(AU;FA;KA;;;WD)  
(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: The first section is the problem area, as this is what grants permission to the Authenticated Users group. In the fix described in KB905809, this section changes to grant Authenticated Users more permissions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular situation, all of the &amp;ldquo;Write&amp;rdquo; permissions&amp;mdash;everything after the &lt;code&gt;(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)&lt;/code&gt; section&amp;mdash;was accidentally removed. So, when the administrator realized what had happened and went back to try to fix it the system kicked back an &amp;ldquo;Access Denied&amp;rdquo; error message, because the permissions had been removed. With no permission to change the permissions, what could be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we found a fix. This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exchangeserveradmin.org/ftopic24842_Could_NOT_change_mail_address_after_windows_server_2003_sp1.html&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; describes a Registry key that someone else had concocted trying to fix this very problem. In my discussions with Microsoft Product Support services, they analyzed this Registry hack and determined that the end result was the same as the SC.EXE command. By importing this Registry fix, we were able to restore the permissions that had been inadvertently removed. We then used SC again (with &amp;ldquo;sdshow scmanager&amp;rdquo;) to verify that the permissions were as they needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate that this Registry fix solved the problem. Had the Registry fix not worked, we most likely would have had to rebuild the server in question&amp;mdash;not a pleasant thought given that we had several hundred users already migrated over to that server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from this situation? Here are my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always type your commands by hand, instead of copying and pasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take appropriate precautions. In large-scale production environments, pull a hot-plug hard drive from the RAID array first. If things go south, shut the server down and reboot from the pristine drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running a command like this, pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question, in my mind, is this: why isn&amp;rsquo;t Microsoft going to fix this bug? We may never know the answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>An Interesting Viewpoint</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I necessarily agree with his viewpoint, but in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7977?CMP=OTC-13IV03560550&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A fake freedom&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, the question is raised: Do we really own our data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the pictures uploaded to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/&#34;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; still yours? What about the bookmarks you&amp;rsquo;ve posted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;? Or the weblog entries on a free weblog service such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;? You think so? Says who?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly paranoid people could be worried that these services might maintain copies of their information, even after the user has requested that they be deleted. Of course, if you are really worried about copies of stuff, you may want to think about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; cache&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, it would probably be a good idea to keep copies of this kind of information somewhere other than these &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; services. Otherwise, you just never know when a site may suddenly go dark, so to speak, for any number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Open Source on Mac OS X</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/06/open-source-on-mac-os-x/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 06 Oct 2005 12:04:41 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/06/open-source-on-mac-os-x/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Most people automatically equate &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo; with Linux or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to open source than that. There are a wide variety of open source projects that are also targeted at (gasp) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a Mac user myself, I was particularly interested in &lt;a href=&#34;http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/09/20/166254&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; recently posted at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsforge.com/&#34;&gt;NewsForge&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the projects listed there were new to me; for example, I had never heard of or used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html&#34;&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;. Given that I don&amp;rsquo;t like brushed metal interfaces (can&amp;rsquo;t stand them) and that I already use a commercial RSS reader, Vienna won&amp;rsquo;t do me much good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the projects listed there, though, I was familiar with and actually using currently. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adiumx.com/&#34;&gt;Adium X&lt;/a&gt; is my default IM client (I use it to stay connected to MSN, AIM, and Google Talk), &lt;a href=&#34;http://cyberduck.ch/&#34;&gt;Cyberduck&lt;/a&gt; is my FTP/SFTP client, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://growl.info/&#34;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; helps keep me informed about what is happening with all the various applications I have running. I&amp;rsquo;ve never used &lt;a href=&#34;http://seashore.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Seashore&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have a look at it soon (I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good image editor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nothickmanuals.info/doku.php?id=opensourcemac&#34;&gt;This link&lt;/a&gt; (also referenced in the NewsForge article) lists an even larger variety of open source Mac applications. Again, some I recognize (and use), a lot that I don&amp;rsquo;t. If you are a Mac user, I encourage you to take another look at some of the many high-quality open source projects available.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Moving Back to Desktop Manager</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/04/moving-back-to-desktop-manager/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2005 09:00:32 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/04/moving-back-to-desktop-manager/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days or so, I have been experimenting with &lt;a href=&#34;http://virtuedesktops.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual desktop application. I&amp;rsquo;ve used various virtual desktop applications since switching to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/09/30/virtual-desktops-on-mac-os-x/&#34;&gt;this blog posting&lt;/a&gt;). After getting used to the lack of a desktop pager, I was really beginning to like Virtue and it&amp;rsquo;s functionality, even though it seemed as though the Virtue project had slowed and/or stopped development. Finally, after searching around for some way of re-instating the &amp;ldquo;Run Application&amp;rdquo; feature in &lt;a href=&#34;http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/&#34;&gt;Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt;, I found that Virtue was incompatible with Mac OS X 10.4, aka &amp;ldquo;Tiger.&amp;rdquo; Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching the possibility of an upgrade to Tiger, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d better switch back to an application that was supposed to run under Tiger (which, based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to find, Desktop Manager does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a real shame, too. Virtue has a great feature set (I love the idea of the &amp;ldquo;primitives,&amp;rdquo; which are text and/or colors that can be applied to individual desktops). I didn&amp;rsquo;t use the per-desktop wallpaper functionality or the per-desktop icons, but I know a few people whose desktop-centric filing system would have really loved those features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were a programmer, I&amp;rsquo;d probably pick up the code myself and run with it. But I&amp;rsquo;m not, so there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Linux on Laptops</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/01/linux-on-laptops/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2005 20:36:15 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/01/linux-on-laptops/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to install Fedora Core 3 (FC3) on three different laptops from three different manufacturers. So far, FC3 has installed and performed without a hitch. The install went flawlessly on all three systems, the video cards and laptop screens were detected and configured correctly, and an old 802.11b PC Card I had laying around was detected without any problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the experts are right; perhaps Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to take on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. If so, it won&amp;rsquo;t be for long. If the open source community continues to drive innovation with solutions like &lt;a href=&#34;http://fedora.redhat.com/&#34;&gt;Fedora Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.samba.org/&#34;&gt;Samba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/&#34;&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnome.org/&#34;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openoffice.org/&#34;&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt;, Linux will continue to become more and more competitive with more popular operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real key, in my opinion, is in winning the next generation over to the possibility of running something other than Windows. This is where Linux and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; are really having some success; I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how many reports I&amp;rsquo;ve read about Linux and Mac OS X usage on college campuses. Once you can get people to actually understand that you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to run Windows on your computer, then the alternatives start to have a future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas, I digress. This post is supposed to be about Linux on laptops. Next time you pull out that older laptop that used to run Windows 98 and wonder what you are going to do with it, try installing Linux on it. You may find that old laptop still has some life left in it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/30/initial-information-on-xc-connect/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may recall, the idea behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xcnetwork.com/&#34;&gt;XC Connect&lt;/a&gt; is that multiple applications across platforms could synchronize data with each other. This would make it possible, for example, for a list of Contacts normally managed inside Outlook to also be shared seamlessly with Linux systems running Evolution and Macintosh clients running iCal. This synchronization would also be possible, in an encrypted fashion, across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests of Windows-to-Windows synchronization are very positive. The but the real test for me is synchronizing between iCal/Address Book and Outlook. If that part works as well as what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen thus far, I will be &lt;strong&gt;truly&lt;/strong&gt; excited. The idea of having a single list of contacts is more enticing than perhaps I can fully elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on performing some additional tests this weekend, and when those tests are complete I&amp;rsquo;ll post more information here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all I have to do is figure out why my Treo won&amp;rsquo;t synchronize fully with my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Virtual Desktops on Mac OS X</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/30/virtual-desktops-on-mac-os-x/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2005 22:15:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/30/virtual-desktops-on-mac-os-x/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost from the moment I switched to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, I started looking for an application to provide the functionality of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop&#34;&gt;virtual desktops&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose my days of dabbling with Linux and the X Window System had ingrained me to believe that a *nix-based system just wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same without virtual desktops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My virtual desktop journey started with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codetek.com/ctvd/&#34;&gt;CodeTek Virtual Desktop&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial product that&amp;rsquo;s very capable. The idea of the desktop pager was very natural, and the ability to automatically switch desktops when switching applications was very handy. I could simply Alt-Tab to the application I needed and CodeTek would automatically switch the appropriate desktop. I could also specify that new windows for a particular application should always be created on a particular desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, I started looking into a new crop of open source virtual desktop managers. &lt;a href=&#34;http://space.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Space.app&lt;/a&gt; was one, but was (granted, this was quite some time ago) still a bit too rough around the edges. I was then turned on to &lt;a href=&#34;http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/&#34;&gt;Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt;, which I used for long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop Manager wasn&amp;rsquo;t as full-featured in some aspects as CTVD, but I really liked the desktop transitions (great way to show off Mac OS X&amp;rsquo;s graphics functionality). The ability to support CTVD pager skins was a nice feature as well, and I really like the overlay of the desktop name on the desktop. One feature that I particularly enjoyed using was the Mac equivalent of the Run dialog box, invoked by Option-Cmd-R. This made it easy to launch an application without having to navigate to the desktop where the Applications folder was found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just within the last day or so, I started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://virtuedesktops.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Virtue&lt;/a&gt;. Virtue&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;claim to fame&amp;rdquo; is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a desktop pager to switch virtual desktops; instead, it uses a translucent pop-up window similar to that used by &lt;a href=&#34;http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/&#34;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m having a bit of a problem getting used to the lack of a desktop pager, but the pop-up bezel is kind of cool, and it looks as if Virtue supports different wallpapers for different desktops. Virtue also appears to be more advanced with regards to applying desktop overlays (like the desktop name, for example). All in all, it looks like a great application. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll stay with it or not; if I do switch back to Desktop Manager, it will be simply because I am too ingrained to use the desktop pager and because I miss my &amp;ldquo;Run&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; keyboard shortcut. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m going to give it an honest try.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>From PGP to S/MIME</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/26/from-pgp-to-smime/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2005 16:40:32 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/26/from-pgp-to-smime/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Not long after switching to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, I also started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgp.com/&#34;&gt;PGP&lt;/a&gt; to provide a digital signature to all my business-related electronic communications. Given the increasing frequency of e-mail messages with spoofed source addresses, I felt that it was only prudent to start providing customers with a way of proving that messages which stated they were from me were actually from me. Besides, that might also cause some customers to ask, &amp;ldquo;Is this something I should be considering as well?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reasonably pleased with PGP. However, I recently started looking at a possible upgrade to the latest version of Mac OS X (&amp;ldquo;Tiger&amp;rdquo;), and noticed that PGP 8.x is not compatible. In fact, PGP stated rather clearly that PGP 8.x is not and would not be compatible with Tiger or future releases of Mac OS X. (This statement was located on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgpsupport.com/&#34;&gt;PGP Support&lt;/a&gt; web site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve researched PGP 9.x and read some reviews, and I&amp;rsquo;m not terribly excited about the new architecture. I&amp;rsquo;d much rather leave my existing SSL/TLS configuration in place and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that my messages are encrypted when going to/from my server, rather than relying on a PGP &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; to enforce policies. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s a good way of handling things, but when it comes down to it I just don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, in order to proceed with an upgrade to Tiger I&amp;rsquo;ll have to a) upgrade to PGP 9.x; b) switch to an open source implementation of PGP, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnupg.org/&#34;&gt;GPG&lt;/a&gt;; c) switch to an alternate form of digital signatures, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME&#34;&gt;S/MIME&lt;/a&gt;; or d) stop using any form of digital signing whatsoever. Having purchased PGP in order to not use GPG, I&amp;rsquo;d say that option is out. Not having any signatures whatsoever isn&amp;rsquo;t really acceptable to me either, so that leaves S/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S/MIME is fine by me, anyway, since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has done a reasonably good job of incorporating S/MIME support into recent versions of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/office/outlook/&#34;&gt;Outlook&lt;/a&gt;. Since a significant portion of my customers and colleagues use Outlook, then it begins to make sense to use S/MIME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be researching which certificate authority (CA) I&amp;rsquo;ll use to issue my S/MIME certificates. I&amp;rsquo;ve registered with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cacert.org/&#34;&gt;CAcert.org&lt;/a&gt;, in the event that I decide to use them. My preference would be to use a CA that can offer me a certificate with my actual name on it. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;m cheap (rather, I&amp;rsquo;m frugal) and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like paying $20/yr just to maintain a certificate. It may be that in order to get my actual name on the certificate I&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already located a number of resources in using S/MIME with Mac OS X 10.3 (&amp;ldquo;Panther&amp;rdquo;), my current version, and those have been added to &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe&#34;&gt;my del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmark list (usually with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe/Encryption&#34;&gt;Encryption&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe/Security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; tags). If anyone has any other resources that may be helpful, feel free to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Error ID c10308a2 is Put to Rest</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/26/error-id-c10308a2-is-put-to-rest/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/26/error-id-c10308a2-is-put-to-rest/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with a bug in an environment running Exchange Server 2003 and Windows Server 2003 with SP1. The bug is manifested as an error that appears when users with the properly delegated permissions attempt to add or modify an e-mail address on an already mail-enabled or mailbox-enabled object. The error, listed as error ID c10308a2, contains text along the lines of being unable to determine if the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying issue is a change that Windows Server 2003 SP1 makes to the security descriptors applied to the Service Control Manager. This change in security descriptors now makes it impossible for non-administrators to query service status; hence, the error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trying to apply the fix suggested by Microsoft in KB905809 (the use of the SC.EXE command), the error was never resolved. It turns out that the workstation I was using the test environment was configured not to use the primary DNS suffix, but instead use a predetermined DNS suffix search list. This configuration resulted in the system&amp;rsquo;s AD domain name &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; being in the suffix search list. As a result, even though the fix from Microsoft was applied, errors still occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I double-checked everything on the test servers as well as the test workstations, corrected the problem described above, and reset the environment to match the production environment. Then, walking through the tests again, I confirmed that running the SC command to add permissions to the Authenticated Users group (see the KB article linked above for more details, then see &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/secauthz/security/security_descriptor_string_format.asp&#34;&gt;this explanation&lt;/a&gt; of SDDL syntax) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; indeed resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, finally, we can put this issue to rest. If you are running Exchange Server 2003 with Windows Server 2003 SP1 and finding that your non-administrative users can&amp;rsquo;t add or modify e-mail addresses using Active Directory Users &amp;amp; Computers, see KB905809 and run the SC command listed in there.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of the new album by Casting Crowns today, &lt;em&gt;Lifesong&lt;/em&gt;. There are a couple of really good tracks, like the title track &amp;ldquo;Lifesong,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Father, Spirit, Jesus&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Set Me Free.&amp;rdquo; Most of the songs, though, are a very different style than Casting Crowns&amp;rsquo; debut album. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit disappointed. After so thoroughly enjoying their first CD, I was really looking forward to their next album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the CD is bad. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I had expected. Songs from their first album really moved you, like &amp;ldquo;Voice of Truth&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Who Am I&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;American Dream&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;If We Are The Body&amp;rdquo;. And they did so with a powerful rock sound. These songs, on the other hand, are much softer. The lyrics are good, but the musical style is not what I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, a few of the tracks from the original album didn&amp;rsquo;t really strike me the first time I heard them, but as I listened to them again I began to enjoy them more. Perhaps the same will happen here.&lt;/p&gt;

          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/22/unrelated-items/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2005 22:16:21 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/22/unrelated-items/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a few things I wanted to mention here, but none of them were really long enough to warrant their own entry. So, I&amp;rsquo;m lumping them all together here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;ve started going back and adding excerpts (or summaries) to most of the entries posted on this weblog. This makes the WordPress archive views cleaner (no more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.technorati.com/&#34;&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt; tags showing up for short entries). I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are probably other reasons why this is a good idea as well, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they are (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the process of adding these excerpts has reminded me of how challenging writing can be. I was always taught to have a firm purpose and focus when writing, and in those cases where that was true the summaries come to me easily. However, for those entries where my focus wandered, I am finding it difficult to summarize and describe what was written. This just really reinforces for me the challenge and the reward of writing here, of being able to effectively communicate and relate ideas to others. It&amp;rsquo;s a skill that many have lost (or never gained) in recent years, and society is worse for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to get all of the weblog customizations in place, at least for now. It&amp;rsquo;s not a radical departure from the default WordPress theme, I know, but it&amp;rsquo;s a decent first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, so maybe these things are related after all&amp;hellip;they all have to do with this weblog.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Another Switcher to the Mac</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/22/another-switcher-to-the-mac/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2005 21:12:15 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/22/another-switcher-to-the-mac/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In reading through a pile of unread industry magazines, I came across an article by Kevin Tolly, a columnist for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkworld.com/&#34;&gt;Network World&lt;/a&gt;, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2005/091205tolly.html&#34;&gt;Closing the door on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, that describes his switch to the Macintosh platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my own personal switch from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; last year was, to borrow a phrase from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoworld.com/columnists/tom_curve.html&#34;&gt;Tom Yager&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the curve. In his article, Tolly describes the experience in these terms (all content copyright of respective holders):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;the bottom line is that I&amp;rsquo;m able to get my work done more efficiently with fewer crashes and have already found &amp;lsquo;richer&amp;rsquo; programs&amp;hellip;which I expect to offer me more than their MS Office counterparts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I can&amp;rsquo;t vouch for the latter part of his statement (I don&amp;rsquo;t use Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/iwork/&#34;&gt;iWork&lt;/a&gt; suite), I can say that my own experience is much the same. The Mac&amp;rsquo;s fluid UI, rock-solid BSD underpinnings, pervasive networking support, and a variety of open source applications make it possible for me to do my job in a very effective manner. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that everyone will have the same result, but it is definitely to say that the Mac is a viable alternative. It is &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; a viable alternative, and more and more people are discovering that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As the next-to-last article in a series of postings about the problem described in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;905809&#34;&gt;KB article&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that Microsoft will not be producing a hotfix for this bug. In speaking with Microsoft earlier today, it appears that no hotfix will be produced for this, even though it is a confirmed bug. As of this afternoon, the only known fix for the problem is using &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; methods outlined in the KB article. I hope to confirm that for sure on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also going to confirm on Monday whether membership in the local Administrators group (on the actual Exchange servers) will also fix the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next posting about this problem will be the last one regarding this issue. Really.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>GPRS vs. Bluetooth</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/22/gprs-vs-bluetooth/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2005 08:03:33 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/22/gprs-vs-bluetooth/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve continued using my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/&#34;&gt;Treo 650&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve run into an apparent conflict between the Treo&amp;rsquo;s GPRS functionality and Bluetooth HotSync support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was trying to HotSync my Treo back to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; so that I could install &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chatopus.com/&#34;&gt;Chatopus&lt;/a&gt;, an IM client for the Treo. (BTW, Chatopus is pretty cool; it&amp;rsquo;s an XMPP/Jabber IM client.) However, every time I tried to HotSync via Bluetooth, I&amp;rsquo;d get the &amp;ldquo;Port is in use by another application&amp;rdquo; error. Reviews of the HotSync log on the laptop showed nothing, which indicated to me that the problem was on the Treo. Just on a whim, I dropped the GPRS connection I was using to retrieve mail in VersaMail and tried again. It worked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only conclusion that I can draw is that having a GPRS connection prevents using Bluetooth to HotSync. Note that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent Bluetooth use in general, since I can use my Bluetooth headset without any problems. It just seems to prevent the use of Bluetooth for a HotSync operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not appear to be a limitation of Palm&amp;rsquo;s HotSync software on the laptop, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think that using something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.missingsync.com/missingsync_palmos.php&#34;&gt;The Missing Sync&lt;/a&gt; (from Mark/Space) will help matters. (I am looking into switching to that software, though.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any additional information on this conflict, please post more information in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/20/inability-to-add-or-modify-e-mail-addresses/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2005 17:01:38 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/20/inability-to-add-or-modify-e-mail-addresses/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up to my posting titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/09/14/another-funky-ad-issue/&#34;&gt;Another Funky AD Issue&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, in which I described a situation with a customer where support staff are unable to modify or add an e-mail address to a mail-enabled or mailbox-enabled user or contact after it has been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is a bug in Windows Server 2003 SP1. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;905809&#34;&gt;KB article&lt;/a&gt; I referenced in the earlier blog posting is also slightly inaccurate; what that article portrays as two separate workarounds to the problem are actually two steps in one workaround. So, in reality, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to perform &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; steps (both the SC.EXE command and the Group Policy Object) in order to fix the problem. (Please note that I have not verified this myself yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it currently stands, the KB article is the only known workaround for this problem. According to the Microsoft Product Support Services people I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken with thus far, it is unknown if Microsoft will issue a hotfix to correct the problem. In the meantime, I have forwarded a URL with another potential fix (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exchangeserveradmin.org/ftopic24842_Could_NOT_change_mail_address_after_windows_server_2003_sp1.html&#34;&gt;this URL&lt;/a&gt;) for Microsoft to analyze and determine if this will help the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other potential solutions include adding the support staff to the local Administrators group on the Exchange server(s); this, clearly, is a less-than-ideal solution. Supposedly, removing Windows Server 2003 SP1 will also correct the problem. (Again, I have not verified this personally.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Product Support Services is supposed to get back in touch with me in the next couple of days with some additional information. I&amp;rsquo;ll post more information here as it becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/17/my-review-of-linux-in-a-windows-world/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I posted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/09/new-book-on-linux-windows-integration/&#34;&gt;blog entry&lt;/a&gt; mentioning a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/&#34;&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&lt;/a&gt; book titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxwinworld/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux in a Windows World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While preparing for my trip to Sweden a few weeks ago, I purchased a copy of the book as reading material for the long transatlantic flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven&amp;rsquo;t finished reading the entire book, but the parts that I have read have been informative. I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on the sections regarding centralized authentication, mostly to see if there are things that I need to do to streamline my own centralized authentication scheme (see my post entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/13/linux-ad-integration-direction/&#34;&gt;Linux-AD Integration Direction&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the approach I took for centralized authentication). Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything earth-shattering, I was able to glean a few helpful details that I will soon be putting into place on my own Linux servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to going over the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.samba.org/&#34;&gt;Samba&lt;/a&gt; section of the book, as I&amp;rsquo;ve often thought of moving my own file/print services to Linux instead of using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. I know this sounds strange, but I have to wonder if SMB interoperability would be better between &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; and Linux instead of between Mac OS X and Windows. Should the opportunity arise for me to test that, I&amp;rsquo;ll post results here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only complaint (albeit a very minor one) is that the author tends to gloss over details in some places. That&amp;rsquo;s understandable, to a point, since the intent of the book is not to explain how to implement all the ideas presented. Otherwise, the book would be unmanageable and unwieldy due to the amount of content. To the author&amp;rsquo;s credit, he does point readers to sources of additional information where they can find the details they need for a real-world implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a relatively high-level overview of some of the various ways in which you can improve Linux-Windows integration on your network, you could do much worse than this book. On the flip side, though, be prepared to dig into some other resources when you need additional detail.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>IMAP, VersaMail, and Mail.app</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/15/imap-versamail-and-mailapp/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2005 23:50:27 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/15/imap-versamail-and-mailapp/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to experiment with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/versamail.epl&#34;&gt;VersaMail&lt;/a&gt;, the e-mail application running on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/&#34;&gt;palmOne Treo 650 smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. GPRS quibbles aside, my only complaint is related to the interactions between VersaMail and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/&#34;&gt;Mail.app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, when I delete a message in VersaMail (and tell VersaMail to delete the message on the server), it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always disappear in Mail.app. Likewise, when I delete a message in Mail.app, it remains in the Treo&amp;rsquo;s Inbox. Even using the Treo&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Sync server folders&amp;rdquo; command in VersaMail doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to correct the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that this is all just the result of slightly differing IMAP implementations. After all, I have seen firsthand how deleting an e-mail message in Mail.app doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;take effect&amp;rdquo; in Outlook until you switch folders in Mail.app. Sometimes you have to use the &amp;ldquo;Empty Trash&amp;rdquo; command as well in order for changes to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not a showstopper, so I&amp;rsquo;m not terribly concerned about it. But, if someone has some information on how I might be able to work around this, that would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked up a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/&#34;&gt;Treo 650&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cingular.com/&#34;&gt;Cingular Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, my current wireless provider, and so far I have to say I am happy with the Treo. As a Palm OS-based organizer, the screen is smaller than what I had grown accustomed to on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/handhelds/tungsten-t3/&#34;&gt;Tungsten T3&lt;/a&gt;, but the resolution seems higher, and I think the color depth is greater as well. As a phone, it seems to work pretty well. The Cingular Wireless GPRS service leaves a bit to be desired, but otherwise works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the Bluetooth functionality, so I can now use the wireless Bluetooth headset I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted for a while. The Bluetooth support seems better on the Treo as well; I found it much easier to get a HotSync working over Bluetooth with the Treo than with the Tungsten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like VersaMail, the Palm OS mail application. Using VersaMail, IMAP/SSL, and SMTP/SSL, I&amp;rsquo;m able to check and respond to e-mail messages wherever I have a decent GPRS signal strength. I was particularly pleased at the SSL support. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to get the Treo downloading e-mail from my Exchange server using IMAP/SSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still exploring options on the Treo, so don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if I post back here in a few days talking about the Treo again.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Another Funky AD Issue</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/14/another-funky-ad-issue/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This one is still unresolved. The basic gist of the arrangement is this: user accounts that have been delegated the appropriate permissions in Exchange System Manager and Active Directory in order to be able to manage user objects (including e-mail attributes) are unable to add or edit e-mail addresses on mail-enabled and mailbox-enabled objects. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;905809&#34;&gt;KB article&lt;/a&gt; that describes the issue perfectly, but the fix doesn&amp;rsquo;t work (at least, not for this specific implementation). The KB article and numerous hits from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search indicate that the use of SC.EXE from Windows Server 2003 SP1 can fix the problem, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and the other workaround offered by the KB article isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly appealing (using Group Policy Objects in Active Directory to add permissions to a service across the network).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Back From Sweden</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/09/back-from-sweden/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2005 22:35:06 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/09/09/back-from-sweden/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We (my wife and I) got back from Sweden on Wednesday, after a thoroughly unpleasant flight experience. After 8 hours of flight in the middle seat, delays in the flight back from Stockholm caused us to miss our flight in Newark, NJ, introducing yet another delay in our return home. Finally, around 6:00 PM EDT, we arrived at the Raleigh-Durham airport, only 3 hours behind our original arrival time. Keep in mind, though, the 6 hour time difference between Raleigh and Sweden; to our bodies, it&amp;rsquo;s now 12:00 AM midnight &lt;em&gt;the next day&lt;/em&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling for a grand total of 18 hours (we left Stockholm around 6:00 AM in the morning). Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most pleasant flight experience we&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the flight home, the trip was enjoyable overall. It was good to see my old friend, who had invited us in the first place for his wedding. The weather was absolutely fantastic; you couldn&amp;rsquo;t ask for better weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things that really stick with me from the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we as Americans are spoiled, and should really learn to appreciate how God has blessed our country. Even with elevated gas prices resulting from Hurricane Katrina, we&amp;rsquo;re still not anywhere close to the $6-7/gallon that gasoline costs in Europe (adjusting, of course, for differences in currency and their use of the metric system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, people are just people. I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how many times we were walking in Stockholm or shopping in the grocery store and found it almost easy to forget that we were half a world away, in a foreign land, speaking a foreign language. Why? Because people there are no different than people here, with their own set of dreams, goals, fears, concerns, etc., just like anyone else. They just happen to speak a very different language and live in a very different land. Think about that next time you start believing that you are the only one that&amp;rsquo;s having a particular problem or issue, and remember that people all around the globe live their life day-by-day just like you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post more information about our trip to Sweden in future entries, perhaps including some of the photos of downtown Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As attested by the fact that you are reading this, my new weblog server running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;WordPress 1.5.2&lt;/a&gt; is now up and running. WordPress will give me more functionality than I had at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, and the freedom to customize my weblog more deeply than I could before.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It looks like things will work out next week that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to post some additional information on some technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up will be access-based enumeration. One of my customers is planning on using this technology and we need to make sure that the potential performance impacts mentioned by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be a deal-breaker. So, once I have some additional information, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next will be the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xcnetwork.com/xcconnect.jsp&#34;&gt;XC Connect&lt;/a&gt; software I mentioned a few posts back. I just finished downloading the Linux version of the XC Connect server software, and hope to have that installed on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; system soon for testing. Again, after some testing with the product, I&amp;rsquo;ll post more information here.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Keeping Priorities in Check</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/17/keeping-priorities-in-check/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2005 18:23:01 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/17/keeping-priorities-in-check/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As technical people, we often immerse ourselves in our work to a far greater extent than people in other fields do. Why? I would imagine that most people, like myself, find this field to be as much of a hobby as it is a career. Sometimes, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, as it gives us the necessary technical edge to excel in a highly competitive arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we take it too far. As I was driving to work this morning, the song &amp;ldquo;American Dream&amp;rdquo; by Casting Crowns (great Christian rock group, by the way; see their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castingcrowns.org/&#34;&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;) started playing. Listening to the song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics, I was reminded of the real priorities in life (all lyrics copyrighted by Casting Crowns):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not this time son I&amp;rsquo;ve no time to waste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Maybe tomorrow we&amp;rsquo;ll have time to play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And then he slips into his new BMW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And drives farther and farther and farther away&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So he works all day and tries to sleep at night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He says things will get better;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Better in time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have we worked late to finish up that &amp;ldquo;important project&amp;rdquo;? You know, the one that just couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait until tomorrow? Too many times. Of course, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time this song has spoken to my heart; I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of Casting Crowns from practically Day One, and this song has always been a powerful one. I thank God that I realized my priorities were wrong years ago, and started putting God and my family first. I say that not to lift myself up or to speak highly of myself, but to give God the glory. To the rest of you techies out there, take note: It &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; possible to be successful in this field without sacrificing what really matters in life.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>XC Connect</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/17/xc-connect/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2005 00:08:14 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/17/xc-connect/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;While browsing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; site for some birthday gift ideas (my birthday is coming up soon and my wife needs some gift ideas; she says I&amp;rsquo;m impossible to shop for), I came across a link to a product called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xcnetwork.com/xcconnect.jsp&#34;&gt;XC Connect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious, so I followed the link and found a piece of software that, if it works as well as it claims, could be an incredible help. At my office, we use a proprietary messaging system that doesn&amp;rsquo;t play so well with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to do reasonably well so far, using third-party tools to push my iCal and Address Book data into this back-end system. XC Connect promises to change all that. Using a Java application deployed on a server (Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X) along with a small client application, XCConnect promises to enable sharing of data between Windows/Outlook, Mac OS X/iCal/Address Book/Entourage, and Linux/Evolution. And it will do this with an encrypted connection between client and server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a free evaluation copy available from the web site, and I can create a Linux server to test it on. Why not? If the application bombs, then I&amp;rsquo;ve only lost some time; if the application rocks, then I&amp;rsquo;ve found a whole new way of sharing data with my co-workers. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know what the verdict is.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Strange NTPd Problem on CentOS 4.1</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2005 23:58:48 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;ldquo;free as in free beer&amp;rdquo; equivalent of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and for the most part I like it. (See &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/08/brief-impressions-of-centos-41/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some additional comments about CentOS 4.1.) However, I&amp;rsquo;ve run into this strange problem with NTPd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve added the appropriate rules in iptables. Yes, the NTPd daemon is running. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve checked connectivity to the time server with which I am trying to synchronize. The &lt;code&gt;ntpdate&lt;/code&gt; utility works like a champ, but NTPd just won&amp;rsquo;t keep the server&amp;rsquo;s time synchronized. OK, am I missing something here? I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; and Red Hat Linux 9.0 servers that synchronize just fine, but not this server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, fed up with the problems, I just scheduled an hourly cron job with &lt;code&gt;ntpdate&lt;/code&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not ideal, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Funky Active Directory Issue</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/16/funky-active-directory-issue/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2005 23:17:43 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/16/funky-active-directory-issue/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across a funky Active Directory issue today. User objects stored in an OU on which permissions had been assigned were &amp;ldquo;losing&amp;rdquo; their permissions and their inheritance from the parent OU. For example, if the group &amp;ldquo;Support Team&amp;rdquo; had been granted a set of permissions on the OU &amp;ldquo;Sales&amp;rdquo;, then the user object &amp;ldquo;Bob Jones&amp;rdquo; stored in that OU would lose those permissions regularly. Even when the permissions were reassigned, they would disappear again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that if the user object is a member, directly or indirectly, of a &amp;ldquo;protected group&amp;rdquo; (such as Server Operators, Backup Operators, or Administrators), then Active Directory automatically removes any inherited permissions, resets those permissions to the default, and turns off inheritance for those objects. The idea is to prevent possible elevation of privileges. This behavior is described in &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;817433&#34;&gt;this KB article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix? Well, you can muck around in Active Directory and play with the adminSDHolder object, or you can just not worry about delegations on those user objects, or you can remove those user objects from the protected group in question. In my particular case, the user objects needed to be taken out of the protected group anyway, so that was a natural fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep this in mind when planning AD delegations and the placement of accounts that will be members of a protected group.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Follow Up on Access-Based Enumeration</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/11/follow-up-on-access-based-enumeration/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2005 21:53:54 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/11/follow-up-on-access-based-enumeration/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/08/access-based-enumeration/&#34;&gt;this posting&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/techinfo/overview/abe.mspx&#34;&gt;access-based enumeration&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to post information from some testing I performed earlier this week. I installed access-based enumeration (ABE) on a server running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt; SP1 (the only version of Windows on which it is supported). It does what it advertises; when a non-administrative user connects to a shared folder on which ABE is enabled, they see only those folders to which he or she has permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations. Administrative users are not affected in any way. ABE only works for network access; users accessing the filesystem locally are not affected. This makes ABE unsuitable for use on terminal servers. Additionally, ABE is enabled or disabled on a share-by-share basis, and while it is possible to turn ABE on or off for all shares at a time there is no provision for setting ABE on by default for new shares. Finally, ABE can negatively impact performance, especially for shared folders with large numbers of files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of split on this one. On the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s really good functionality that will dramatically change the way system administrators approach Windows-based file servers. On the other hand, the potential performance drawbacks of ABE are concerning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are running file servers on Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 installed, you owe it to yourself to at least evaluate ABE. You may find that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for your network, but then again you may find that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go on without the added functionality that ABE brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/&#34;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; is as successful with OpenSuSE as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redhat.com/&#34;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; was with Fedora. I may just give SuSE 9.3 a try to see if I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;but SSL is not so easy. I found a workaround for using &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt;; in order for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isc.org/products/INN/&#34;&gt;INN&lt;/a&gt; to not think it&amp;rsquo;s another news server feeding it information and instead treat it like a reader, I had to alias another IP address and bind Stunnel on that IP address. It works, but it&amp;rsquo;s not my ideal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll have to compile INN from source myself in order to get SSL support in nnrpd (that&amp;rsquo;s the component that handles connections from NNTP readers). It&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal, I know. It&amp;rsquo;s just my history compiling from source has been a bit rocky.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;My work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isc.org/products/INN/&#34;&gt;INN&lt;/a&gt; 2.3.5 as an internal news server is progressing, and I must admit that the configuration of authentication and SSL is going well. Authentication works like a champ, leveraging PAM and therefore automatically leveraging the Kerberos/LDAP integration with Active Directory I implemented a short while ago. The SSL stuff is just a bit trickier; I initially tried the old faithful &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt;, but found that INN thought the connection was coming from itself and not a reader. That caused INN to respond differently. I&amp;rsquo;ll start looking at native SSL support within INN next, but that can wait until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Internal News Server Up and Running</title>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/08/internal-news-server-up-and-running/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to get an internal news server running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/inn/&#34;&gt;INN&lt;/a&gt; 2.3.5 up and running, and transferring data from the proprietary platform that is currently hosting some internal newsgroups. I decided to use my first real installation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; for the internal news server, and so far it has worked out well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a newsfeed to transfer new postings from the proprietary application over to INN, and I&amp;rsquo;m using pullnews right now as I write this to transfer the old articles over. Aside from some limitations and failures which I believe to be the result of the proprietary application&amp;rsquo;s specific implementation of NNTP (which I, personally, feel is another &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/05/14/nonstandard-implementations/&#34;&gt;nonstandard implementation&lt;/a&gt;), everything seems to be transferring over rather well. The next step will be to add authentication to the INN installation, and then add SSL support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more nail in the coffin of a certain proprietary groupware application&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Brief Impressions of CentOS 4.1</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/08/brief-impressions-of-centos-41/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/08/brief-impressions-of-centos-41/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/13/trying-a-new-linux-distribution/&#34;&gt;earlier entry&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; distribution, a &amp;ldquo;clone&amp;rdquo; of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty impressed with it. Granted, I was coming from Red Hat Linux 9.0 (RH9), a (now) old distribution using the 2.4 kernel. So, many of the changes I&amp;rsquo;m seeing with CentOS 4.1 may be more due to the fact that it is running the 2.6.x kernel, has SELinux installed, etc., rather than anything else. It seems to boot more slowly than RH9, but is otherwise reasonably equivalent with regards to performance and memory utilization. I&amp;rsquo;m already using a mix of RH9 and Fedora Core packages on the existing servers, so there isn&amp;rsquo;t that much new (with regards to packages) with CentOS 4.1 that I don&amp;rsquo;t already use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring some unforeseen problem that I have not yet encountered, I will probably migrate the majority of the Linux servers I currently maintain over to CentOS 4.1 over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that &lt;a href=&#34;http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Asterisk@Home&lt;/a&gt; (the &amp;ldquo;pre-packaged&amp;rdquo; VoIP PBX installation) also runs on CentOS.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>First Windows Vista viruses unleashed</title>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/08/first-windows-vista-viruses-unleashed/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Among many other online appearances, the article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,103682,00.html&#34;&gt;First Windows Vista viruses unleashed&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com&#34;&gt;ComputerWorld&lt;/a&gt; describes the first family of viruses (virii?) that appear to be targeted specifically at the new Windows Vista operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be ridiculously easy to make a joke here, but let me take a different tack. First, this is beta (some would say pre-beta) code, so of course there are going to be &amp;ldquo;security holes&amp;rdquo; (I use this term loosely) that have not yet been closed. Microsoft, take this as a signal that you need to continue to focus on security and making sure that any new functionality you are add to Windows Vista gets properly secured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the target of this virus is not Windows Vista &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, but rather the &amp;ldquo;Monad&amp;rdquo; object-oriented scripting environment. According to what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, this environment is not slated to be included by default with Windows Vista. Included by default or not, Microsoft, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure that you don&amp;rsquo;t turn &amp;ldquo;Monad&amp;rdquo; into a virus-writer&amp;rsquo;s delight. Make it work, make it work well, and make it secure.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about getting a car with built-in Bluetooth at some point in the future (like when I win the lottery), but now I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. Here&amp;rsquo;s why: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,103656,00.html?source=x73&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Car Whisperer&amp;rsquo; puts hackers in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/05/ipsec-mac-os-x-and-windows-server-2003/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;For quite some time now, a minor task I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with is establishing transport mode IPSec security associations between &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a freeware IPSec client called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lobotomo.com/products/IPSecuritas/&#34;&gt;IPSecuritas&lt;/a&gt;. Up until just a few days ago, I could never get anything to work. After working on getting a PPTP-based VPN working from my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;, I realized that just as I had to modify my ipfw rules (using BrickHouse) to allow the PPTP traffic, I&amp;rsquo;d have to modify the rules to allow IPSec traffic as well. Duh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making the changes to allow ISAKMP (UDP port 500), ESP (IP protocol 50), and AH (IP protocol 51), I created a quick-and-dirty IP Security policy on the Windows box. Lo and behold, it looked as if an SA was established. However, within just a few seconds after IPSecuritas&amp;rsquo; log showed the SA established, then it appeared as if racoon (the back-end for IPSec on Mac OS X) crashed. I have not yet figured out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the apparent racoon crash, it looked like the SA was still valid. I was not able to verify encryption by sniffing the traffic, but it certainly seemed like everything was working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the problems thus far, this is still good news to me. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping I can figure the rest of the problem out.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just found a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; handy add-on for Mac OS X. It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xutils.com/rdcmenu/&#34;&gt;RDC Menu&lt;/a&gt; and it is a tool that provides an easy way of launching multiple instances of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient&#34;&gt;Remote Desktop Connection&lt;/a&gt; application for the Mac. If you manage Windows-based networks, you already know how useful Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) is, but the one key flaw in RDC was that you couldn&amp;rsquo;t launch multiple instances and thus couldn&amp;rsquo;t be connected to more than one Windows computer at a time. With RDC Menu, all that changes. Working as either a Dock item or as a Menu Extra, it allows you to easily launch multiple instances of RDC to connect to multiple Windows-based systems. I run RDC Menu as a Dock item (I don&amp;rsquo;t like too many Menu Extras).&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always heard good things about SuSE, but have never had the opportunity to work with it in greater depth. Now, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com&#34;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1843097,00.asp&#34;&gt;detailed its plans&lt;/a&gt; to open SuSE to community development in a manner similar to the approach used by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redhat.com&#34;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fedora.redhat.com&#34;&gt;Fedora Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. Anything that Novell can do to broaden the reach and influence of SuSE will certainly help both Novell and the SuSE Linux distribution itself. As it gains more attention, people will be more likely to develop &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; SuSE.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/08/03/squid-pix-integration/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been searching for the last few days on some techniques to integrate a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squid-cache.org/&#34;&gt;Squid web cache&lt;/a&gt; with a PIX firewall in a transparent fashion. Most of the information I am finding involves using the Squid web cache as the default gateway along with an iptables firewall that transparently redirects outbound TCP port 80 traffic to port 3128 (the Squid web cache port). The web cache then talks to the PIX, which takes it from there. Certainly, this works, but it is not what I was hoping to find. I&amp;rsquo;d really like a way to have the PIX redirect the traffic, but it appears that the PIX OS does not support that functionality. How can this be? The &lt;code&gt;pf&lt;/code&gt; firewall in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; supports redirection, if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken. The &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; firewall in Linux supports redirection. But not Cisco&amp;rsquo;s PIX OS? Is it just me, or does anyone else see a problem with this?&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Phil Zimmerman, the creator of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), is back, this time working to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841509,00.asp&#34;&gt;provide secure VoIP&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Phil resurrected PGPfone, updated it with modern protocols, and has created Zfone, a prototype application that will provide encryption for voice-over-IP calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be something to watch. I agree with Phil that nobody is really paying any attention to the security of VoIP traffic moving across the Internet, and it&amp;rsquo;s about time somebody thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent article from &lt;em&gt;Computerworld&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,103607,00.html&#34;&gt;Hackers at Defcon race to expose Cisco Internet flaw&lt;/a&gt;, states: &amp;ldquo;Computer hackers at this weekend&amp;rsquo;s Defcon 13 hacker event worked to expose a flaw publicized last week that could allow an attacker to take control of Cisco Systems Inc. routers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of thing that I suspected would rise out of the whole Cisco-ISS-Black Hat snafu. Particularly perturbing is the comment made by one attendee, who stated &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;we&amp;rsquo;re doing this&amp;hellip;because someone said you can&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very much in favor of full disclosure, as I feel it brings a measure of accountability to the vendors that might otherwise not be present. But there is a limit. Full disclosure needs to be handled responsibly and in context, taking into account the bigger picture (so to speak). I think Larry Seltzer&amp;rsquo;s recent article at &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1842310,00.asp&#34;&gt;Where Does Truth Lie in Lynn/Cisco Case?&lt;/a&gt;, said it best when he said, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;flaws in Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS needed to be disclosed at some point, but when and where was not [Lynn&amp;rsquo;s] to say.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Are we warning about pending threats, or are we creating the new threats ourselves? Do these kinds of presentations help us protect our computers and our networks, or do they give the other side the ammunition they need?&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Cisco IOS = Windows XP?</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/29/cisco-ios-windows-xp/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2005 15:43:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/29/cisco-ios-windows-xp/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blackhat.com/main.html&#34;&gt;Black Hat&lt;/a&gt; conference in Las Vegas certainly generated a great deal of excitement this past week. A security presentation was going to be given about a first-ever exploit for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; routers. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to decipher, Cisco had been working closely with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iss.net&#34;&gt;ISS&lt;/a&gt;, the company whose researcher (Michael Lynn) was supposed to give the presentation, and both companies apparently agreed that the presentation needed further review. Cisco and ISS &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841232,00.asp&#34;&gt;jointly filed an injunction&lt;/a&gt; against Michael Lynn when he &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,103515,00.html&#34;&gt;quit his job at ISS to give the presentation&lt;/a&gt; anyway; this is after Cisco employees physically removed presentation pages from the books handed out at the conference and destroyed CDs containing information about the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appeared as if Lynn was going to give a VoIP presentation instead, but then &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841166,00.asp&#34;&gt;proceeded with the original presentation&lt;/a&gt; anyway, even though he knew it would likely result in lawsuits from Cisco and his former employer. In the presentation, he likened Cisco&amp;rsquo;s IOS (Internetwork Operating System) to Microsoft Windows XP, saying &amp;ldquo;IOS is the Windows XP of the Internet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Thursday, a court order was issued and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,103561,00.html&#34;&gt;all parties involved have agreed&lt;/a&gt; to the terms of the court order, which restrict them from further sharing or disseminating any information about the security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Cisco and ISS have taken a real hit from this whole situation, and I can understand why. Cisco looks like it&amp;rsquo;s trying to cover up security vulnerabilities; it was only after all of this that Cisco issued a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050729-ipv6.shtml&#34;&gt;security advisory&lt;/a&gt; discussing the vulnerability. If Michael Lynn&amp;rsquo;s research was accurate, then it is appropriate for people to know so that our networks can be protected. Cisco network equipment running IOS does, indeed, power a large portion of the Internet. &lt;em&gt;At the same time&lt;/em&gt;, if he violated the law and the terms of his agreement with Cisco by reverse engineering IOS, then he should not have publicized that information. &lt;em&gt;But then again&lt;/em&gt;, it appears as if Cisco would not have released security information had Mr. Lynn not proceeded with the presentation, so&amp;hellip;you see that this issue is sensitive and there are reasonable and understandable concerns on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I would have done if I were in the same situation. The only advice that comes to mind is, &amp;ldquo;If you do what is right, you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong.&amp;rdquo; But what is &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>VPN Integration Done</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;That was easier than I expected. I managed to get my hardware firewall to authenticate VPN connections against Active Directory via &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS&#34;&gt;RADIUS&lt;/a&gt; (using Internet Authentication Service, or IAS) without a great deal of effort. In fact, it was almost easy. If I ever get caught up on documentation, I&amp;rsquo;ll post some details on how to do it on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurionsystems.com/index.html&#34;&gt;Mercurion Systems&lt;/a&gt; web site.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Next Integration Task(s)</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/24/next-integration-tasks/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2005 23:58:13 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/24/next-integration-tasks/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;With the majority of my Linux servers now authenticating against Active Directory, I&amp;rsquo;m now able to broaden my integration focus and work on some related tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SASL2/PAM:&lt;/em&gt; I still have one server, running SASL2, that has not been switched over to the standard Kerberos/LDAP configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to research the interplay between SASL2 and PAM before I tackle this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenBSD Authentication:&lt;/em&gt; I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched any of the OpenBSD servers yet for Kerberos/LDAP authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VPN Authentication via RADIUS:&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d like to use RADIUS to handle some VPN authentication against Active Directory as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate this should be too terribly difficult, but it is something that is rather new to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apache Authentication via Kerberos to AD:&lt;/em&gt; One of the documents that helped me in getting the pam_krb5 stuff working was for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grolmsnet.de/kerbtut/&#34;&gt;using mod_auth_kerb with Apache&lt;/a&gt; (more information also posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://sl.mvps.org/docs/LinuxApacheKerberosAD.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well). I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy this for some select areas of our intranet and extranet sites, to add an additional layer of security on top of what is already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is in addition to trying to establish an internal news server running INNd (and then migrating content from Exchange Server 2003 into this news server) and working on Squid log analysis tools. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably start investigating Squid authentication options as well, since that would be very helpful to my customers (especially if I can get the authentication to be transparent, or very nearly so). On top of that I have duties in church, work as a manager overseeing employees, and things to do as a dad. Whew! I often wonder if I am just not efficient with managing my time, or if I just have too much to do.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, my Linux-AD integration task is pretty much complete. I have three Linux servers authenticating via &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www&#34;&gt;Kerberos&lt;/a&gt; to Active Directory, and using LDAP for name/group resolution. Only one Linux server remains; I need to do some research on how &lt;a href=&#34;http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/&#34;&gt;SASL&lt;/a&gt; with interact with PAM before I can switch over that particular server. My &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; server I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave alone for now; perhaps later I&amp;rsquo;ll get it integrated as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to see what is involved in using RADIUS to authenticate VPN tunnels on my hardware firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/06/21/dangerous-stuff/&#34;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; a while back about concerns that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware&#34;&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt; makers were adding &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_kit&#34;&gt;rootkit&lt;/a&gt; functionality to their products to make them harder to detect and harder to remove. It seems that trend has gotten the attention of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. (About time, I say.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Malicious Software Removal Tool&lt;/a&gt; has been enhanced with the ability to find and remove rootkit-like trojans and backdoor applications. In addition, Microsoft has indicated that it will likely &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1838294,00.asp&#34;&gt;incorporate anti-rootkit functionality&lt;/a&gt; into future versions of its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx&#34;&gt;AntiSpyware&lt;/a&gt; product, acquired with Giant Software and still in beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rootkits have been reported on virtually all major operating systems, so we can&amp;rsquo;t really knock Microsoft for allowing rootkits to infect Windows. We can, however, insist that as long as Microsoft makes it possible for the operating system to be compromised in such a significant way through the use of a web browser, then such stuff as &lt;a href=&#34;http://research.microsoft.com/rootkit/&#34;&gt;Strider Ghostbuster&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s anti-rootkit technology) should continue to be offered to Windows users at no charge.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As a quick follow-up to my previous posting, testing with Kerberos authentication from a Linux server with pam_krb5 was successful. Instead of using a user account in Active Directory to generate the keytab, I was able to use a computer account and just had to modify the ktpass.exe command line syntax slightly (see my previous post).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Minor Linux-AD Hiccup Fixed (Hopefully)</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/18/minor-linux-ad-hiccup-fixed-hopefully/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2005 00:18:41 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/18/minor-linux-ad-hiccup-fixed-hopefully/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I have resolved one minor Linux-AD integration hiccup. In setting up the Kerberos authentication, various instructions I had found (including some from Microsoft) indicated I needed to create a &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt; account for the Linux servers, then use &lt;code&gt;ktpass&lt;/code&gt; to generate the Kerberos keytab. This works, but being the stickler for detail that I am, I really wanted to use a computer account instead of a user account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fiddling with it for a while, I finally managed to make it work. The &lt;code&gt;ktpass&lt;/code&gt; command should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ktpass -princ host/fqdn@REALM -mapuser DOMAIN\name$  
-crypto DES-CBC-MD5 -pass password -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL  
-out filename
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The missing piece, for me, was specifying &lt;code&gt;DOMAIN\name$&lt;/code&gt; for the mapuser parameter. Without it, the command kept generating an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure that this will work, but I will be testing this within the next day or so to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the local &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifewaystores.com/lwstore/&#34;&gt;LifeWay&lt;/a&gt; yesterday to spend a gift card the kids had purchased for me as a Father&amp;rsquo;s Day gift. While I was there, I found that the latest album from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matthewwest.com/&#34;&gt;Matthew West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt;, was available, so I picked up a copy. Good stuff! I&amp;rsquo;d heard the latest single from the album, &amp;ldquo;Next Thing You Know,&amp;rdquo; on the radio, but as I was listening to it again this morning on the way to church God really blessed me again. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how a song that maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve heard a dozen times or more can really touch your heart. To me, that&amp;rsquo;s just another indicator that no matter how much we think we know God, there&amp;rsquo;s still more to Him than we could ever imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, go grab a copy of &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; and listen to it. I think the Lord will really speak to you.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, limited success, anyway. I have managed to get Linux authentication to occur via &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www&#34;&gt;Kerberos&lt;/a&gt; against Active Directory. LDAP is used to lookup the user and group information. Using pam_krb5, authentication occurs via Kerberos to an Active Directory DC for any PAM-aware application. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I&amp;rsquo;ll find some hiccups along the way, but so far things look good. I only have 1 server configured this way for now (a non-essential server), but after some additional testing I&amp;rsquo;ll expand this to the remainder of my Linux servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post more details here and/or on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurionsystems.com/index.html&#34;&gt;Mercurion Systems&lt;/a&gt; web site once all the bugs have been worked out. My thanks go out to the many, many individuals who posted information on using Kerberos and LDAP with Active Directory; this would not have been possible without their assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are planning an in-place upgrade of your server running Exchange 2000 to Exchange Server 2003, beware of the Badmail folder. Apparently, during the Exchange Server 2003 setup process, the setup application tries to go back and stamp ACLs (access control lists) on all the objects in the installation directory. This, by default, includes the Badmail directory. If your Badmail directory contains lots of items (which, in an Exchange 2000 installation, it probably does), then this can cause the Setup process to appear to be hung. Microsoft has published &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;822578&#34;&gt;this KB article&lt;/a&gt; discussing the issue and the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in Exchange Server 2003 SP1, Microsoft has changed the behavior of Exchange to use the Badmail folder only if explicitly configured to do so (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;884068&#34;&gt;this KB article&lt;/a&gt;). No more monitoring the Badmail folder!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, for those networks that have not yet deployed Exchange Server 2003 SP1, Microsoft has released the &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;867642&#34;&gt;BadMailAdmin tool&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this, and it works as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Trying a New Linux Distribution</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/13/trying-a-new-linux-distribution/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2005 22:57:06 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/13/trying-a-new-linux-distribution/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a Linux expert, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t really spent a great deal of time wandering the various Linux distributions to see which one(s) I really like. I have been primarily using Red Hat Linux 9.0 (RH9), even though it&amp;rsquo;s an older distribution with an older kernel that is no longer supported. I tried the Fedora Core distributions, but just kept coming back to trusty old RH9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than continue to try to shoehorn RPMs built for one of the various Fedora Core versions onto RH9, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to try a new distribution. But before you congratulate me for venturing into the brave new world of Linux distributions, you should wait to hear what I&amp;rsquo;m going to try next. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt;, a free redistribution of the source RPMs that comprise RHEL. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but with all references, branding, artwork, etc., for Red Hat removed from the source RPMs and then recompiled. I&amp;rsquo;m downloading the ISO images for CentOS 4.1 right now from an FTP mirror at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncsu.edu&#34;&gt;North Carolina State University&lt;/a&gt; (Go Wolfpack!). I&amp;rsquo;ll post my impressions of CentOS 4.1 once I get it installed and running. (That&amp;rsquo;s assuming I can make it work under &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I am continuing to explore more uses for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, which I find that I really enjoy working with.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Modifying Camino&#39;s Exceptions List for Cookies</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/13/modifying-caminos-exceptions-list-for-cookies/</link>

          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/13/modifying-caminos-exceptions-list-for-cookies/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a stickler about cookies. No, not the kind you eat&amp;hellip;the kind that web servers place on your computer when you visit a web site. I understand that cookies are sometimes necessary to maintain state as a user navigates through a web site; HTTP is, after all, a stateless protocol. But a cookie for every site no matter what? That just gets on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, I had &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&#34;&gt;Camino&lt;/a&gt; configured to ask if I wanted to allow a cookie or not. This got time-consuming when I was visiting a site I had never visited before and all the ad servers wanted to place a cookie to track me. I wanted a way to tell Camino, &amp;ldquo;Block all cookies unless I say otherwise.&amp;rdquo; Finally, in Camino 0.9a1, I can set all cookies to be denied and then view the exception list, but there was still no way to edit the exception list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the determined (read: stubborn) person that I am, I was determined to find a way to edit this exceptions list. (As a side note to the Camino developers, please write a UI for editing the exception list.) After not too much searching, I found that the &lt;code&gt;hostperm.1&lt;/code&gt; file in &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/Camino&lt;/code&gt; is an ordinary text file that contains the exceptions list. To add a site to this list, simply follow the same format as one of the existing lines, specifying 1 to allow cookies or 2 to deny cookies. Of course, any editing to this file should be done while Camino is not running.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time over the last few days researching some of the various ways in which to allow users to login to Linux servers using their credentials from Active Directory. Along the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve found some useful articles; notably, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkcomputing.com/1305/1305ws1.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timkennedy.net/docs/Linux+Active_Directory.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/12/09/2258243&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. These are also bookmarked in &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe&#34;&gt;my del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmark list under the &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe/Linux&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks as if the best solution involves the use of &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www&#34;&gt;Kerberos&lt;/a&gt; for authentication and LDAP for user/group name resolution. As fate would have it, as soon as I decide to use Kerberos, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1836591,00.asp&#34;&gt;new security holes&lt;/a&gt; are discovered. At least these security holes don&amp;rsquo;t involve Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s implementation of Kerberos, but they will affect the Linux Kerberos clients. Hopefully, patches for the affected portions will be released reasonably quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this project evolves, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to post more information here. A final &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; will likely also be posted on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurionsystems.com/&#34;&gt;Mercurion Systems web site&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose since I didn&amp;rsquo;t post this until Wednesday, the title isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly correct, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has released the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms05-jul.mspx&#34;&gt;security bulletin&lt;/a&gt; for July, which contains 3 critical updates (updates rated &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo; are considered the most severe by Microsoft). These updates patch security vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer, and Windows (including Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP SP2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had previously released a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/903144.mspx&#34;&gt;workaround&lt;/a&gt; for the Internet Explorer flaw (note that this page now directs users to the location of the update rather than the earlier workaround).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional information on the patches can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1836227,00.asp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Firefox Updates and Roadmap</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/13/firefox-updates-and-roadmap/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/13/firefox-updates-and-roadmap/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla released &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; 1.0.5, which patches a number of security vulnerabilities. You can get more information on the release &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1836310,00.asp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or by visiting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org&#34;&gt;Mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt; web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1821168,00.asp&#34;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; has been revealed about Firefox 1.1, the next version of the open source web browser. An alpha version of Firefox 1.1 could be ready within just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Mozilla can continue to innovate with Firefox and address my two primary concerns&amp;ndash;ease of deployment and distributing security updates&amp;ndash;then they will continue to steal market share away from Internet Explorer. If nothing else, Mozilla will at least force Microsoft to be competitive again, and that is a success in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is also updating &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird&#34;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, the companion e-mail client to Firefox, and that update is expected to be available soon as well.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the RSS feeds from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macosxhints.com&#34;&gt;Mac OS X Hints&lt;/a&gt; today pointed me to a website on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dns-sd.org/&#34;&gt;DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)&lt;/a&gt;. DNS-SD is part of the magic behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/&#34;&gt;Bonjour&lt;/a&gt; (formerly named Rendezvous), the way in which &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; is able to automatically locate services across the network. Bonjour is used, for example, in locating an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/&#34;&gt;Airport Extreme&lt;/a&gt; base station, or used by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caminobrowser.org&#34;&gt;Camino&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/&#34;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt; to find web servers on your network. Personally, I like Bonjour, and it&amp;rsquo;s good to see that it is finally being extended beyond single-segment implementations. And, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://a1408.g.akamai.net/7/1408/9955/20050505/akamai.info.apple.com/Bonjour/061-1768.20050505.BJWdw/BonjourSetup.exe&#34;&gt;Bonjour for Windows&lt;/a&gt; available from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s starting to look like a viable cross-platform solution for finding and connecting to network services automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caminobrowser.org&#34;&gt;Camino 0.9a1&lt;/a&gt;, the latest version of the native &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; browser, for the last few days. I have to say that I am impressed. I like the new features on the Go menu that shows the most recently visited websites; this makes it easier to flip back to a site than having to switch to the &amp;ldquo;Bookmarks&amp;rdquo; view. The new tab bar is much better as well; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stand the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nada.de/mac/camitools/&#34;&gt;CamiTools&lt;/a&gt; add-ons for Camino 0.9a1 are also excellent; I&amp;rsquo;m using both CamiOptions as well as CamiFlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using Camino now, you should give this new version a spin. You&amp;rsquo;ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Ongoing Microsoft-Claria Saga</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/claria_letter.mspx&#34;&gt;public statement&lt;/a&gt; regarding the downgrade of Claria software in their anti-spyware product (which now recommends that users ignore the Claria software instead of remove it) isn&amp;rsquo;t sitting well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1835770,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt;, a number of spyware experts call Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s explanation less than satisfactory. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edbott.com/weblog/archives/000844.html&#34;&gt;Ed Bott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.benedelman.org/news/063005-1.html&#34;&gt;Ben Edelman&lt;/a&gt;, and others have all commented on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s explanation. The overwhelming consensus is that users don&amp;rsquo;t trust Microsoft to be honest. And why should they? Unfortunately, Microsoft has placed itself in an unenviable position, and only by being completely squeaky clean and transparent will it be able to avoid a backlash over actions such as this.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, barring some unforeseen disaster or God leading us otherwise, my wife and I are going to Stockholm, Sweden, around Labor Day. A good friend of mine is getting married and we&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to the wedding. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit scary, as the only foreign country I have ever visited was Mexico, and that was to a high-traffic tourist area. Somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that thousands of Americans visit Stockholm in September every year. Anybody know any Swedish?&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/09/new-book-on-linux-windows-integration/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;While searching for Linux-Windows integration articles to assist in my project to unify Linux authentication with Active Directory, I came across an entry in Robbie Allen&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rallenhome.com/blog/adcookbook/&#34;&gt;Active Directory Cookbook blog&lt;/a&gt; that was talking about a new book titled &lt;em&gt;Linux in a Windows World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/&#34;&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&lt;/a&gt; has indeed published &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxwinworld/&#34;&gt;Linux in a Windows World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Looks to be a good book; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to pick up a copy soon.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A New Effort</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/09/a-new-effort/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2005 23:09:53 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/09/a-new-effort/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should be finishing one project before starting another, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself. I&amp;rsquo;m going to take on the project of integrating my Linux systems with Microsoft Active Directory, so that a single Active Directory account can be used to authenticate to both Windows-based systems as well as Linux-based systems on our network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new effort comes while I have yet to finish my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/05/13/miscellaneous-projects/&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; on Squid log analysis tools or an internal news server running INN. At least I did get &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/05/15/perdition-working-now/&#34;&gt;Perdition working&lt;/a&gt; as expected, and figured out how to get &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/02/starttls-and-imap-in-mailapp/&#34;&gt;Mail.app to use STARTTLS with IMAP4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of the resources I&amp;rsquo;m using for this effort are bookmarked in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmark list. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding more there as I find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have yet to decide if I will use Samba/Winbind or LDAP to handle the cross-platform authentication. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear any comments or feedback in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/08/access-based-enumeration/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt; has finally caught up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/netware/&#34;&gt;Novell NetWare&lt;/a&gt; in one key area, and that is in the enumeration of files and folders. With &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=04A563D9-78D9-4342-A485-B030AC442084&amp;amp;displaylang=en&#34;&gt;access-based enumeration&lt;/a&gt;, Windows Server 2003 now will display only those files and folders to which the user has permission. If no permission is given, the file or folder is not displayed. This is, in my opinion, a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; improvement in Windows&amp;rsquo; security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to give this functionality a swing on my own servers within the next few days. I&amp;rsquo;ll post additional details here after my tests.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Stupid Tricks With The Mac OS X Firewall</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/07/stupid-tricks-with-the-mac-os-x-firewall/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2005 22:54:40 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/07/stupid-tricks-with-the-mac-os-x-firewall/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting way to block access to your &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; system. Simply modify your ipfw script to block traffic to or from the 127.0.0.0/8 network. When you do this, your Mac will simply fail to log you in, instead presenting you with an endless spinning disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only workaround is to hold down the Shift key while booting (to initiate a Safe Boot), then disable the StartupItem that launches and configures the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I speak from personal experience, having added the aforementioned rules in an effort to block spoofed traffic from accessing the loopback interface. Apparently, Mac OS X is different enough from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; that this advice (advocated on a couple of FreeBSD-related sites I found while searching for ipfw information) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;At least it can&amp;rsquo;t be said that I only identify and write about Microsoft-related security flaws. (I&amp;rsquo;d like to not have to write about security flaws at all, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1834632,00.asp&#34;&gt;This Zlib flaw&lt;/a&gt; affects Linux, BSD, and even some Microsoft products. It&amp;rsquo;s an equal opportunity security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described in the linked article above, patches have already been released for a number of products affected by the Zlib flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Enough Bundling Already!</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/07/enough-bundling-already/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2005 18:09:10 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/07/enough-bundling-already/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; bundles Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player with every copy of Windows, and then integrates them so deeply that a flaw in one of these applications can compromise the entire system. But bundling adware/spyware?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1833611,00.asp&#34;&gt;this rumor&lt;/a&gt; about Microsoft acquiring Claria, the company that distributes the Gator ad-serving software. It was just a rumor, and one that not very many people took seriously. But now, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1834607,00.asp&#34;&gt;this news&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s anti-spyware program has lowered the rating on Claria&amp;rsquo;s software and changed the default action to &amp;ldquo;Ignore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? In reality, nothing. It may have been just an oversight, or it may be that Claria has reached some sort of monetary agreement with Microsoft. In the meantime, I would recommend (as I have in the past) using multiple anti-spyware applications to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Linux Better Than Windows?</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/06/linux-better-than-windows/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2005 14:31:35 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/06/linux-better-than-windows/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A short while back &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsforge.com/&#34;&gt;NewsForge&lt;/a&gt; published an article comparing Windows to Linux. What&amp;rsquo;s so unusual about that, you may ask? This article, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/05/18/2033216&#34;&gt;Windows rapidly approaching desktop usability&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; takes a look at Windows as if &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;, not Linux, were the upstart newcomer in the OS lineup. This is a viewpoint not often considered, and it is a valid viewpoint once you get over the &lt;strong&gt;presumption&lt;/strong&gt; that Windows should be the default OS on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of valid points made in the article. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Microsoft Windows XP, Home Edition, with Service Pack 2, is a tremendous improvement over previous Windows versions when it comes to stability and appearance, but it still has many glitches that keep it from being competitive with GNU/Linux for everyday users, including a tedious installation procedure, lack of productivity software included with the operating system, hardware compatibility problems, and a price so much higher than any of the Linux distributions&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong; I&amp;rsquo;m not advocating that everyone out there should suddenly ditch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; and migrate to Linux. Are there situations where Linux is a better fit than Windows? Of course. Likewise, there are situations where Windows is a better fit than Linux. And, of course, there&amp;rsquo;s always &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; to consider as well.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Although the title may indicate otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m actually glad to see more browsers popping up for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. Choice is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new kid on the block this time is &lt;a href=&#34;http://hmdt-web.net/shiira/index-e.html&#34;&gt;Shiira&lt;/a&gt;, a WebKit-based browser that offers some pretty useful features. These features include Tab Expose, which is Expose for browser tabs (activated via F8); &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.growl.info/&#34;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; integration; integration with Safari Bookmarks; and a clean, native Aqua interface. Because it uses Apple&amp;rsquo;s WebKit (now open sourced and available &lt;a href=&#34;http://webkit.opendarwin.org/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), it renders pages the same way as Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like some features about Shiira (especially the Growl integration and the tabbed browsing implementation), but still find myself going back to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&#34;&gt;Camino&lt;/a&gt;. A new alpha version of Camino 0.9 has been released, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t brought myself to use it yet. If Camino had a way to provide notifications via Growl (I&amp;rsquo;d really like for my browser to notify me when a download is complete), I would be just absolutely thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Shiira is an open source project, released under a BSD style license.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;For those readers in the US, I want to wish you a very enjoyable and very happy Fourth of July! As we celebrate another year of independence and freedom, take some time to remember those soldiers fighting overseas to preserve our freedom here as well as to give others the same kind of freedom. Also take the time to thank the one true Author of freedom, and that is God. May God bless each of you, and may God bless America!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Those individuals searching for an open source alternative to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/office/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t the only Microsoft monopoly, you know) on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; should take note of NeoOffice/J 1.1, released a few weeks ago. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macnn.com/articles/05/06/21/neooffice.j.1.1.released/&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macnn.com/&#34;&gt;MacNN&lt;/a&gt; alerted me to the release a while ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve only just now gotten around to mentioning it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made no secret of the fact that I try not to be partial in any way with regards to technology solutions. If NeoOffice/J fits your needs, perfect. If not, use Microsoft Office. It&amp;rsquo;s just nice to see that we actually &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; some choices, however limited they may be, when it comes to choosing office productivity software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also hoping that the approval of the XML-based OpenOffice 2.0 file formats by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oasis-open.org/&#34;&gt;OASIS&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1819239,00.asp?&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;) will help further spur more interoperability between office productivity applications. Now, if we could just get Microsoft on board with this vendor-neutral format&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>STARTTLS and IMAP in Mail.app</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/02/starttls-and-imap-in-mailapp/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2005 20:47:16 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/02/starttls-and-imap-in-mailapp/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/05/14/nonstandard-implementations/&#34;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; earlier about my frustration with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; Mail.app mail client and its apparent lack of STARTTLS support with IMAP4. Well, on a whim today I decided to take this issue back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Exchange&lt;/a&gt; does not support STARTTLS, I had to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/&#34;&gt;Perdition&lt;/a&gt; as an IMAP proxy in front of Exchange. Earlier attempts to get Mail.app to do STARTTLS had failed (not sure why), but today I decided to try changing the IMAP port from 993 (the default when you check the &amp;ldquo;Use SSL&amp;rdquo; box) to 143 (the standard IMAP4 port). Oddly enough, it seemed to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious to find out for sure, I trotted out tcpdump on the mail gateway running Perdition to capture traffic to/from Mail.app and to/from the back end mail server. The traffic to/from the back end mail server was transmitted in the clear (I used plain text messages so that I could see the content), but the traffic to/from Mail.app was not readable. I also saw Mail.app issue a CAPABILITY command, then issue a STARTTLS command. Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it appears that Mail.app does indeed support STARTTLS for IMAP, but only if you set the port number back to 143 after checking the &amp;ldquo;Use SSL&amp;rdquo; checkbox.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;After some fiddling around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, I got the transparent RDP tunneling inside SSL working. I still need to run some network captures with Ethereal or similar to make sure that the traffic is encrypted, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see any reason why it won&amp;rsquo;t be. Overall, the process was a bit easier than I expected. Once I get it better documented, I&amp;rsquo;ll find an appropriate format in which to distribute the information for others to use in their own networks.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2005 17:32:09 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/07/01/watch-out-ie-users/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of articles are highlighting a recently uncovered security flaw in Microsoft Internet Explorer&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1833697,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,102924,00.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;ComputerWorld&lt;/em&gt;, both of which reference this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/903144.mspx&#34;&gt;security advisory&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is to set the Security Level for the Internet Zone to High, which disables the functionality required for the exploit to work. Unfortunately, it also disables a lot of other things that non-malicious sites use, so this workaround will affect your ordinary browsing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. While Firefox was shown to be vulnerable to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1830025,00.asp&#34;&gt;recent spoofing flaw&lt;/a&gt; (this flaw also affected IE, Safari, Camino, etc.), it&amp;rsquo;s still better than IE&amp;rsquo;s security record. And, yes, for those of you out there who are yelling at your computer screens right now: I know that you probably believe that Firefox is only more secure because there are fewer people using it. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s true, but the end result is that it&amp;rsquo;s more secure. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what we are seeking to achieve?&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Practicality Perspective</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/30/the-practicality-perspective/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2005 21:16:43 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/30/the-practicality-perspective/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent opinion article from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1826033,00.asp&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hot Ideas Don&amp;rsquo;t Always Win the Race&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (or &amp;ldquo;Just too hot an idea,&amp;rdquo; in the print version of &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt;) takes a very practical view of Apple&amp;rsquo;s move to the Intel platform. Basically, while the PowerPC is technologically superior to x86 CPUs, the best technology doesn&amp;rsquo;t always win. We saw this with OS/2 (far superior to Windows 95) and the MCA bus architecture, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with him. As technical people, we need to be sure to take a step back from the &amp;ldquo;this technology is better&amp;rdquo; argument and look at the choice from a practicality perspective. And that goes not only for assessing this specific incident, but for the rest of our technical decisions as well. Sure, Linux may be superior to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; from a technology perspective (I&amp;rsquo;m not saying it is or it isn&amp;rsquo;t), but is it the most practical decision? Sure, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; may be far superior to Linux (again, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying it is or it isn&amp;rsquo;t), but is it the most practical decision? Does it make the most sense not only from a technical viewpoint, but also from a business perspective? From a cost perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful in our IT careers, we must look at these kinds of things from all perspectives, including the practicality perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Transparent RDP Tunneling</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my experimentation with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; 3.7, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to setup a way of transparently tunneling RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol, used by Windows Remote Desktop/Terminal Services) inside SSL. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that I can use IP aliases and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt; to have &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; RDP encapsulated in SSL by Stunnel and then passed off to another instance of Stunnel at the other end. Then, from the RDP client, I just connect to one of the IP aliases and the rest is handled transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get it working, I&amp;rsquo;ll post more details here as well as on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurionsystems.com/&#34;&gt;Mercurion Systems&lt;/a&gt; web site.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/26/running-windows-apps-on-an-intel-based-mac/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting side effect of Apple&amp;rsquo;s announcement to move the Macintosh platform to Intel-based CPUs: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeweavers.com/&#34;&gt;CodeWeavers&lt;/a&gt; has announced that they will expand their services and products to include the new Intel-based Macs (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/24/1530234&amp;amp;from=rss&#34;&gt;CodeWeavers sees Mactel move as an opportunity&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsforge.com/&#34;&gt;NewsForge&lt;/a&gt; site). More information is also available in the official CodeWeavers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20050622&#34;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very good thing. If CodeWeavers is successful in making a version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/&#34;&gt;CrossOver Office&lt;/a&gt; to run on the Intel-based Macs, it will make it easier to users to choose whatever platform best suits their needs, be it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, Linux, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;. They won&amp;rsquo;t feel tied to a specific platform just because there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; application they need that only runs on &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; specific platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/virtualpc/virtualpc.aspx&#34;&gt;Virtual PC for the Mac&lt;/a&gt; to run any Windows-specific programs I need. This works reasonably well, but takes a performance hit because it has to emulate an Intel-compatible CPU. With Intel-based CPUs under the hood already, Virtual PC (or CrossOver Office, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/&#34;&gt;Xen&lt;/a&gt;, or any other emulation software) will practically fly. This makes emulation a much more attractive option than it is right now. That, in turn, means more choice and more freedom for end users.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2005 16:01:32 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/26/virtualization/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization/&#34;&gt;virtualization&lt;/a&gt;. I love the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; products (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/desktop/ws_features.html&#34;&gt;VMware Workstation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/server/gsx_features.html&#34;&gt;GSX Server&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/products/server/esx_features.html&#34;&gt;ESX Server&lt;/a&gt;) and, as I have mentioned in previous posts, use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/virtualpc/virtualpc.aspx&#34;&gt;Virtual PC&lt;/a&gt; product currently (but only because VMware doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a Mac version of VMware Workstation). I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to hardware-based virtualization technologies such as AMD&amp;rsquo;s Pacifica (discussed briefly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1780606,00.asp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1820551,00.asp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and Intel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.intel.com/technology/computing/vptech/&#34;&gt;Vanderpool&lt;/a&gt; technology. I&amp;rsquo;m very much hoping that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; will take the plunge and build in virtualization support in Mac OS X 10.5, aka &amp;ldquo;Leopard&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtualization is more than just running multiple operating systems on a single computer, though. Virtualization occurs in networking through the use of virtual LANs (VLANs) and virtual private networks (VPNs); both of these technologies are core technologies in today&amp;rsquo;s flexible networks. Virtualization occurs in storage area networks (SANs) as virtual disks and virtual SANs (VSANs). Technologies such as load balancing via virtual servers (recently read an interesting &lt;a href=&#34;http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/05/27/0612243&#34;&gt;article on Linux virtual servers&lt;/a&gt;) also employ a form of virtualization. Even mundane technologies such as network address translation (NAT) can be considered forms of virtualization, since they abstract a server&amp;rsquo;s public IP address from its private (actual) IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As IT professionals, it behooves us to embrace new technologies like virtualization, in all its forms. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already taken the time to get used to these kinds of products and technologies, now might be a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/25/not-the-same/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished installing the latest version (3.7) of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, and I was reminded of just how different OpenBSD and Linux really are. Those on the &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; just see them as Unix-like operating systems, but they really are much more different than you might expect. I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in either (I just dabble), but the differences are even evident to me. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet had the opportunity to experiment with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netbsd.org/&#34;&gt;NetBSD&lt;/a&gt;, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know if these differences are particular to OpenBSD or to all BSDs when compared to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I find that I really like OpenBSD. I think that the more that I use OpenBSD, the more ways I will find that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use OpenBSD. It won&amp;rsquo;t replace Linux in my environment, but it is a very worthy addition to the network.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone remember Blaster? There are concerns that the next big Internet worm is about to surface, based upon a vulnerability revealed by Microsoft in the Windows implementation of Server Message Block, or SMB. Get the details on that patch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-011.mspx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several articles have been posted recently indicating that traffic patterns have been observed that might indicate an exploit of that vulnerability. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,102747,00.html&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; indicates that some experts believe the traffic patterns are indicative of a new exploit, but others are not concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent than even that article is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1831325,00.asp&#34;&gt;this posting&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that an exploit for MS05-011 has actually been discovered and made available on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is there anything you can do to protect yourself? Most firewalls (network-based and host-based) already block TCP port 445, the port used by SMB. If you know your organization allows SMB across the firewall, then you should be concerned. Make sure your systems are patched properly, and keep your anti-virus up to date. That&amp;rsquo;s about all you can do: just stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s articles like this one from NewsForge entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://technology.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/14/1632224&amp;amp;from=rss&#34;&gt;Pipes and Filters&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrate why I like Linux and other Unix-like operating systems (such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;). This kind of command-line wizardry isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as possible on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. At least, not as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s a good article for those that are new to LDAP. I&amp;rsquo;m neither new to LDAP nor an expert, but this article was helpful in solidifying some basics.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Dangerous Stuff</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/21/dangerous-stuff/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2005 13:47:22 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/21/dangerous-stuff/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet grows more dangerous every day. Why? Well, have a look at this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1829744,00.asp&#34;&gt;recent eWeek article&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1818369,00.asp&#34;&gt;slightly older eWeek article&lt;/a&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;ll see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware/&#34;&gt;Spyware&lt;/a&gt; acting like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_kit/&#34;&gt;root kits&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus/&#34;&gt;Viruses&lt;/a&gt; taking on root kit features and able to hide their processes? This is scary stuff. When one of these malicious programs exploits a vulnerability in your web browser, you could get infected and not even know it. And if that application starts using I/O blocking to hide its processes and NTFS data streams to hide files inside other (legitimate) files, you&amp;rsquo;re really in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; may only be more secure than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; because not as many people use it, but the end result is the same. If you use Windows, at least protect yourself&amp;ndash;don&amp;rsquo;t use Internet Explorer (use &lt;a href=&#34;www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;), stay up to date on patches (visit Windows Update regularly), use an anti-virus application (and keep it updated as well), and use a good anti-spyware program (there are several, take your pick). You&amp;rsquo;ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Why I Use a Mac</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/20/why-i-use-a-mac/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2005 21:21:10 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/20/why-i-use-a-mac/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A fair number of people have asked me why I use an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/hardware/&#34;&gt;Apple Mac&lt;/a&gt; when my business centers primarily around &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; products such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;, Active Directory, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Exchange&lt;/a&gt;? That&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My computer is simply a tool to get my job done. About two years ago, I started to evaluate the tasks that I tackle on a regular basis as part of supporting my customers&amp;rsquo; networks. In reviewing those tasks, it become evident to me that using Windows myself was not a prerequisite for designing, installing, and supporting Windows-based networks. I could run a different OS&amp;ndash;like Linux or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;and still be perfectly able to get my job done. In fact, given that I wanted to increase the amount of work that my company did with open source software such as Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt;, and SpamAssassin, something other than Windows might actually make that &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then set out to compare the alternatives. After comparing Linux and Mac OS X, I found that Mac OS X had the best fit for &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; particular needs. I loved the mix of open source technologies (the BSD underpinnings and various other open source projects) and closed software (the ultrasmooth Aqua interface). I loved the hardware. And, most importantly, I found that there were applications available for Mac OS X to help me get my job done. (See my blog posting about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/06/20/preferred-mac-os-x-applications/&#34;&gt;Preferred Mac OS X Applications&lt;/a&gt;.) The fact that many of the applications I needed for my job were open source applications was a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Mac OS X right for you? I don&amp;rsquo;t know; that depends upon what you do at your job. I believe that Mac OS X is a great fit for more people than Windows, but I also believe that people must use what is most ideally suited for their work. If that is Windows; so be it. If that is Linux, then great. And if, like me, it is Mac OS X, then fantastic. Each of these operating systems have their own strengths and weaknesses, and it is up to each user to determine which OS is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Preferred Mac OS X Applications</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/20/preferred-mac-os-x-applications/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2005 00:36:34 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/20/preferred-mac-os-x-applications/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should go ahead and post the obligatory list of preferred &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; applications. So, without further ado, here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SFTP Client:&lt;/em&gt; I used to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/&#34;&gt;Fugu&lt;/a&gt;, but switched not too long ago to &lt;a href=&#34;http://cyberduck.ch/&#34;&gt;Cyberduck&lt;/a&gt;. I like Cyberduck&amp;rsquo;s Synchronize feature (to keep local and remote directories synchronized) and the built-in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.growl.info/&#34;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; support. I still keep Fugu around, but don&amp;rsquo;t use it nearly as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web Browser:&lt;/em&gt; I primarily use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&#34;&gt;Camino&lt;/a&gt;, although I will use Safari from time to time. I know that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is available in a Mac OS X version, but I just prefer Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usenet Client:&lt;/em&gt; I tried a couple of open source applications, but finally settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.panic.com/unison/&#34;&gt;Unison&lt;/a&gt;. My only complaint with Unison is that I can&amp;rsquo;t post a message to a newsgroup and send a copy of the message to someone&amp;rsquo;s e-mail address at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RSS Reader:&lt;/em&gt; Again, I tried a couple different applications (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/&#34;&gt;NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a&gt;) but was most satisfied with &lt;a href=&#34;http://freshsqueeze.com/products/pulpfiction/&#34;&gt;PulpFiction&lt;/a&gt;. The Mail.app-like interface and built-in Growl support fit my work habits well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instant Messaging:&lt;/em&gt; The open source &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adiumx.com/index.php&#34;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt; client won my heart, although &lt;a href=&#34;http://fire.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; was a very close second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organization:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/&#34;&gt;OmniOutliner&lt;/a&gt; is a great application, very versatile and very flexible. I&amp;rsquo;ve found numerous uses for it so far, and expect that I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to find more and more ways to use this application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miscellaneous Applications:&lt;/em&gt; These applications defy any sort of categorization. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.growl.info/&#34;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; notification system, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/&#34;&gt;ecto&lt;/a&gt; blogging client, &lt;a href=&#34;http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/&#34;&gt;Desktop Manager&lt;/a&gt; virtual desktop application, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/&#34;&gt;Cocoalicious&lt;/a&gt; del.icio.us client all have a home on my PowerBook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t live without &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/mac/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ical/&#34;&gt;iCal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/isync/&#34;&gt;iSync&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/&#34;&gt;OmniGraffle&lt;/a&gt;, and others. This list should at least get things started.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Some Cool Networking Stuff</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/17/some-cool-networking-stuff/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2005 00:19:21 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/17/some-cool-networking-stuff/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I setup some cool networking stuff today with some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hp.com/&#34;&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt; ProCurve switches. A customer of mine was converting from a T-1 based WAN to an Ethernet MAN. The carrier brought in a separate Ethernet drop for each location, and I configured a separate port-based VLAN for each drop and then set up routing between them. All in all, it took about an hour to convert all the locations from the old WAN to the new MAN, and 50 minutes of that was spent driving from location to location (everything is in the same city).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s nothing unusual (I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are those of you out there that do this stuff everyday), but I was particularly pleased at how smoothly we managed to make the conversion for all 12 locations. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;d done this before many times with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; equipment, but this was only the second time using HP equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a write-up of this on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurionsystems.com/&#34;&gt;company web site&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in more details, look there soon.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>New del.icio.us Links</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/14/new-delicious-links/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2005 00:42:41 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/14/new-delicious-links/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple new links to &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe/&#34;&gt;my del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmarks. Most notably, I&amp;rsquo;ve added an entry for a recent article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onlamp.com/&#34;&gt;ONLamp.com&lt;/a&gt;, a site hosted by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreillynet.com/&#34;&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Network&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modsecurity.org/&#34;&gt;mod_security&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/06/09/wss_security.html?page=1&#34;&gt;Securing Web Services with mod_security&lt;/a&gt;, is a great introduction to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://httpd.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; module that I&amp;rsquo;ve known about and used for a while now. Similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx&#34;&gt;URLScan&lt;/a&gt; for IIS 5.0, mod_security serves to block malicious URLs and invalid requests, even within encrypted HTTPS sessions. As such, it acts as the perfect complement to firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (both network-based and host-based), which typically operate at lower layers of the networking stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Apache, I urge you to evaluate and deploy mod_security to enhance your web server&amp;rsquo;s security.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m adopting a new hyperlinking convention with this post and all future posts. From this post on (I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been doing this already for the last few posts), I&amp;rsquo;ll only hyperlink the first instance of a company, product, term, etc., rather than all instances of that item within a posting.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of you probably use &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;, or have at least heard of it. You may not have heard of a native &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; client for del.icio.us called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/&#34;&gt;Cocoalicious&lt;/a&gt;. If you use del.icio.us and Mac OS X, you should give this application a try.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Apple on Intel</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/13/apple-on-intel/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2005 13:41:02 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/06/13/apple-on-intel/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was away in Florida on vacation, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced at WWDC 2005 that they will transition to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.intel.com/&#34;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; CPUs over the next couple of years. I won&amp;rsquo;t try to predict what this will mean, or whether Apple will go away, or anything deep like that. It makes perfect sense from a hardware perspective; Apple needs faster CPUs because the whole theme of &amp;ldquo;processor speed doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter&amp;rdquo; just isn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it with the masses. The ordinary John and Jane Doe out there don&amp;rsquo;t know that a 2.5GHz G5 is as equally powerful as a 3.6GHz Pentium 4. They just know that the Pentium 4 is faster, and that means the system is better, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, not for the PowerPC CPU inside. Did the PowerPC G4 processor add an era of mystique, of uniqueness? Sure. In the end, however, I bought a PowerBook because I liked Mac OS X and because I could get the applications I needed to get my work done on a Mac. If I can do that with an Intel-powered Mac that is just as fast or faster, then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Truth be told, I do worry about Apple&amp;rsquo;s hardware business, though, and what this will mean for them. Time will tell.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got back from my family vacation in Florida. It was (for the most part) a very relaxing two weeks. I had the opportunity to visit a small &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.churchofgod.cc/&#34;&gt;Church of God&lt;/a&gt; congregation in Kissimmee, FL (the Living Waters Church of God&amp;ndash;if you live in the area or are going to be visiting the area, go by and see them) and was alerted to a potential ministry for my wife and I within the church. We&amp;rsquo;ll see where God leads with that. Of course, I also had the chance to see some theme parks, swim in the pool, go to the beach, and spend some time with my family. All in all, a well-deserved and well-enjoyed vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the process of trying to clean up all the various accounts and subscriptions and what not that I have out there, I have switched to a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; account. You can now find my bookmark list at &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/slowe/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us/slowe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know how to close an old del.icio.us account?&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Split E-Mail Routing</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/19/split-e-mail-routing/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/19/split-e-mail-routing/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/&#34;&gt;Perdition&lt;/a&gt; up and running (although not in the way I really wanted; see my post titled &amp;ldquo;Perdition Working Now&amp;rdquo;), I&amp;rsquo;m moving on to setting up an internal news server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can get the internal news server up and running, though, I must first address the issue of e-mail submissions to these newsgroups. See, right now I can send an e-mail to &lt;em&gt;newsgroupname@domain.com&lt;/em&gt; (this is obviously an invalid address) and that message will be posted to the newsgroup. This works well because the mailboxes and the newsgroups live on the same server and the mail gateway can route all messages to this server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I setup a separate news server, however, I&amp;rsquo;ll need some e-mail addresses to be directed to the mail server, but other e-mail addresses (the e-mail addresses for the newsgroups) to a different server altogether. I think that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt; can do this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know that for certain yet. I suspect that the answer lies somewhere in the mystery of virtual&lt;em&gt;alias_maps, but I just can&amp;rsquo;t wrap my head around it right now. Of course, it _&lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; getting late here so that may explain it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>An Unexpected Answer</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever prayed a prayer, only to have God answer that prayer in the most unexpected, most unplanned way possible? Today, on Pentecost Sunday, the day in which we celebrate the giving of the Holy Spirit, God answered a prayer for me. In one of those really weird ways that only make sense when viewed through the eyes of faith, God blessed me with a burden. And through this burden I will have the opportunity to show His love, His grace, and His mercy. Praise the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Perdition Working Now</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/15/perdition-working-now/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2005 16:31:02 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/15/perdition-working-now/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to get &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/&#34;&gt;Perdition&lt;/a&gt; working. Still unable to confirm if &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Mail.app supports STARTTLS (my experience thus far says No), I had to resort to using &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt; to wrap IMAP inside an SSL tunnel, then forward the IMAP traffic to Perdition on the same host. The Perdition proxy then passes the traffic to the back-end mail server. It&amp;rsquo;s not the solution that I really wanted, but it will do for now. At least the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Exchange Server 2003&lt;/a&gt; IMAP server isn&amp;rsquo;t exposed directly to external networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a slightly related note, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slipstick.com/&#34;&gt;Slipstick Systems&lt;/a&gt; web site has a link to an IMAP proxy server that implements STARTTLS as a workaround for Exchange&amp;rsquo;s lack of native support for STARTTLS. The IMAP proxy can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slipstick.com/files/imapproxysvc.zip&#34;&gt;http://www.slipstick.com/files/imapproxysvc.zip&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have an IMAP4 client that supports STARTTLS and want to connect it to Exchange, you can use this IMAP proxy. At least, until &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; puts STARTTLS support into Exchange directly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Nonstandard Implementations</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/14/nonstandard-implementations/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2005 22:24:04 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/14/nonstandard-implementations/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my experiments with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/&#34;&gt;Perdition&lt;/a&gt;, I learned a couple of very interesting facts. First, the IMAP4 implementation on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Exchange Server 2003&lt;/a&gt; does not support the STARTTLS command, as described in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc2595.txt&#34;&gt;RFC 2595&lt;/a&gt; and re-affirmed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc3501.txt&#34;&gt;RFC 3501&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Exchange expects an SSL session to be established immediately, and then IMAP is spoken. This is similar to the &amp;ldquo;smtpd_tls_wrappermode&amp;rdquo; directive that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt; supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it appears that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; Mail application (commonly referred to as Mail.app) also uses this IMAP-over-SSL approach, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Mail.app to connect to Exchange using IMAP with SSL for quite some time. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to confirm that now, but having precious little luck finding any definitive information one way or the other. If anyone knows for certain, please let me know. I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things that just makes me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Miscellaneous Projects</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/13/miscellaneous-projects/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my copious spare time (fellow parents out there know this is a joke), I&amp;rsquo;m working on a couple of miscellaneous technical projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal news server:&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m having so many problems with NNTP-based access from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.panic.com/unison/&#34;&gt;Unison&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Exchange Server 2003&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to setup an internal NNTP server using Linux and INNd. Linux I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with; INNd is completely new to me. Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMAP proxy:&lt;/em&gt; This would use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vergenet.net/linux/perdition/&#34;&gt;Perdition&lt;/a&gt; to proxy IMAP4S requests to my mail server. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have Perdition handle IMAP4S and then pass IMAP to the back-end server, offloading the SSL work to the proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squid log analysis:&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a way to parse down the logs from my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squid-cache.org/&#34;&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt; web cache. Once I find a way to do this, then I can really begin offering Squid and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.squidguard.org/&#34;&gt;SquidGuard&lt;/a&gt; as a content filtering solution to some of my customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure this stuff is probably old hat to some of you out there. Feel free to contribute some helpful information or URLs. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you posted on how things proceed with these and other projects as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Shaohannah&#39;s Hope</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/13/shaohannahs-hope/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe that we should support adoption as an alternative to abortion. In the absence of a serious medical need to abort a baby, there seems no reason to me to kill a baby when lots of couples would love to adopt that child and raise it as their own. That&amp;rsquo;s especially true when they can&amp;rsquo;t have children of their own naturally. Of course, when it comes to a subject like this everyone has their own opinion. That&amp;rsquo;s OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe like I do, then I would encourage you to look into supporting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shaohannahshope.org/&#34;&gt;Shaohannah&amp;rsquo;s Hope&lt;/a&gt;. This organization, launched by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stevencurtischapman.com/&#34;&gt;Steven Curtis Chapman&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, Mary Beth Chapman, seeks to encourage adoption as a Christian ministry. It&amp;rsquo;s something worth praying about.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Welcome</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/05/11/welcome/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2005 22:53:20 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try a weblog of my own. As indicated in the title, I can&amp;rsquo;t promise regular updates, I can&amp;rsquo;t promise any consistency in the topics I&amp;rsquo;ll post about, and I can&amp;rsquo;t promise that I won&amp;rsquo;t say something that might offend you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re OK with all of these caveats, then please read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some general background about me. I&amp;rsquo;m an IT professional running my own company, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mercurionsystems.com/&#34;&gt;Mercurion Systems&lt;/a&gt;, based in the Raleigh, NC area. We&amp;rsquo;re currently a pretty small company, but hoping to grow in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also a dad, trying hard with my wife to raise our family. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail on my family here, such as providing names or ages of kids, or anything like that, because (to be perfectly honest) none of you really need to know that kind of information. Suffice it to say that it is a large family and that I am blessed to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that leads me to my final (and perhaps most important) piece of information, and that is that I am a Christian. That I am going to openly discuss my beliefs and my religion here will probably offend some people, but my Christianity and my faith are interwoven into all that I am and all that I do. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to speak honestly here and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; involve my faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, I hope that something you find here will a) help you solve a technical problem; b) encourage you as a parent; or c) lift you up in your faith. At the very least, it should help you occupy some time.&lt;/p&gt;
