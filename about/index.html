  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>
  

<p>Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Scott Lowe, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Personal Information</h3>

<p>I live with my wife, Crystal, and our kids in the Denver, CO area. When I&rsquo;m not working or spending time with my family, I&rsquo;m enjoying the outdoor life or working in our church.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Professional Information</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in the Information Technology field for 20 years, starting out with desktop support. Along the way, I worked as an instructor, a technical trainer and Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), systems administrator, IT manager, systems engineer, consultant, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for a small start-up, and practice lead for a national VAR&rsquo;s VMware practice. Most recently, I worked as a forward-looking technologist for a large enterprise storage vendor based in the northeast US. Currently, I work as an engineering architect for VMware, focusing on network virtualization and software-defined networking (SDN).</p>

<p>In addition, I am a former contributor to <a href="http://searchvmware.techtarget.com">SearchVMware.com</a>, a VMware-focused website with technical articles, how-to&rsquo;s, tips, and news. I also had some articles published on <a href="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com">SearchServerVirtualization.com</a> and I am a former columnist for <a href="http://virtualizationreview.com/Home.aspx">Virtualization Review</a> magazine.</p>

<p>I currently have six published books to my credit, all published by Wiley/Sybex:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Mastering VMware vSphere 4</em>, published around VMworld 2009</li>
<li><em>VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference</em> (with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson), published in late 2009</li>
<li><em>VMware vSphere Design</em> (with Forbes Guthrie and Maish Saidel-Keesing), published in March 2011</li>
<li><em>Mastering VMware vSphere 5</em>, published in October 2011</li>
<li><em>VMware vSphere Design, 2nd Edition</em> (with Forbes Guthrie), published in March 2013 with updated content for vSphere 5.1 and vCloud Director</li>
<li><em>Mastering VMware vSphere 5.5</em> (with Nick Marshall, who will now take over this series), published in November 2013</li>
</ul>

<p>All six books are available from Amazon.com and other major booksellers.</p>
