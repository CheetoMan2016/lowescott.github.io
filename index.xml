          <description>&lt;p&gt;Two separate reports (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1906177,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article from eWeek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,107375,00.html&#34;&gt;this article from ComputerWorld&lt;/a&gt;) have risen today regarding a &amp;ldquo;zero-day&amp;rdquo; exploit of a vulnerability in Windows&amp;rsquo; handling of WMF (Windows Metafile) images. According to the reports, simply viewing a WMF file (such as from a web site) can infect your computer. Sunbelt Software&amp;rsquo;s blog also offers &lt;a href=&#34;http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/new-exploit-blows-by-fully-patched.html&#34;&gt;more details on the vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; as well. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16074/info&#34;&gt;more information&lt;/a&gt; from SecurityFocus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the reports, this newly discovered WMF vulnerability will allow crackers to run the code of their choice on the affected system(s). So far, the exploit has been limited to installing spyware, adware, and keyloggers, but there is little doubt in anyone&amp;rsquo;s mind that the attackers will grow much worse very quickly. The vulnerability can be exploited in a variety of ways, such as visiting hostile web sites (using either Internet Explorer, Opera, or Firefox); opening an affected WMF file in Windows Picture and Fax Viewer; or previewing an affected file in Windows Explorer. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this vulnerability affects even fully patched systems &lt;em&gt;with all available patches installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the only workaround is to uninstall Windows from your computer and immediately install Linux. OK, just kidding. Seriously, though, the only known workaround at this time is to unregister the affected DLL using this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;regsvr32 /u shimgvw.dll
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; when prompted. This unregisters the affected DLL and eliminates the vulnerability; however, this may also affect the viewing and previewing of many other types of images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still early yet in the discovery process, so I fully anticipate that more workarounds and more information will emerge as the security researchers continue their work.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Initial Impressions of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in a couple of previous posts, I have several servers running Red Hat Linux 9.0 that I am looking to upgrade to a newer distribution. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a couple of recent versions of CentOS (a clone version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux), but ran into &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;problems with ntpd&lt;/a&gt; (I may have &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/23/centos-ntpd-problem-mostly-resolved/&#34;&gt;finally resolved&lt;/a&gt; those). I&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to give that a try as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/08/ubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;experience with Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;some time with Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;) led me to believe that Debian would be equally polished. So, I downloaded two ISO&amp;rsquo;s for Debian 3.1 (&amp;ldquo;Sarge&amp;rdquo;), the latest stable release. Information I&amp;rsquo;d gained from some online research indicated by this release included a 2.6.8 version of the kernel, but upon installation I found I was running a patched 2.4 version instead. After a couple of attempts to upgrade the kernel via &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;, I finally managed to locate an appropriate package name in the stable distribution and installed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the 2.6.8 kernel cause the system to fail to boot, listing numerous segmentation faults and finally just halting partway into the boot process. I was extremely disappointed&amp;mdash;after having spent that time downloading the software and then installing it, it was now completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that Debian fans will point out that I surely did something incorrect and things normally don&amp;rsquo;t happen that way. Perhaps that is true; I will certainly be the first to admit that I may have done something incorrectly while using &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; to upgrade the kernel. I would be nice to know exactly &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; it was that went wrong, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m going to shelve Debian GNU/Linux as a possible replacement OS and continue searching. At this point, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; is starting to look really good&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>CentOS NTPd Problem (Mostly) Resolved</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/23/centos-ntpd-problem-mostly-resolved/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The NTPd problem that I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;wrestled with in CentOS 4.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;again in CentOS 4.2&lt;/a&gt; has finally been resolved. Mostly. I think. The specific steps I took to resolve the issue came from a number of sources, so read on for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these servers are virtual servers running under &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, I first consulted the VMware Knowledge Base and turned up this article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/support/kb/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=Nuh3rAXh&amp;amp;p_lva=&amp;amp;p_faqid=1420&amp;amp;p_created=1093994398&amp;amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9ncmlkc29ydD0mcF9yb3dfY250PTc0MyZwX3NlYXJjaF90ZXh0PUxpbnV4IGd1ZXN0IGNsb2NrJnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9NyZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMT1_YW55fiZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMj1_YW55fiZwX3NvcnRfYnk9ZGZsdCZwX3BhZ2U9MQ**&amp;amp;p_li=&#34;&gt;slow and fast clocks for Linux guest VMs&lt;/a&gt;. Based on that information, I added a few extra commands to the grub configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;noapic nosmp nolapic clock=pit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I found a number of forum postings in various sites (too many to list or link here) that referenced problems with NTP and ACPI. So, based on that information, I further edited the grub configuration to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;noapic nosmp nolapic clock=pit acpi=no
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, based on information regarding NTP itself and the NTP configuration parameters, I added the &amp;ldquo;burst iburst&amp;rdquo; parameters to the server lines in my &lt;code&gt;ntp.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;server W.X.Y.Z burst iburst
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helped, as at least now NTP would synchronize against something other than the local clock (which was more than it had done previously). For some reason, though, the &lt;code&gt;/var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; log file was filling up with messages about synchronizing against the local clock, then synchronizing against the server, then against the local clock, etc. (You get the picture.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I was synchronizing against a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;-based computer, I thought perhaps that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s NTP implementation was simply broken. (This certainly wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time.) So I configured &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openntpd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenNTPd&lt;/a&gt; on an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; server (running OpenBSD 3.8) and re-configured the CentOS server to synchronize against the OpenBSD NTP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside&gt;OpenNTPd is ridiculously simple to configure and operate, and _just works._&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repetitive synchronization messages still appeared, but were appearing with far less frequency. And the time still isn&amp;rsquo;t synchronized to the level I would like, but it does stay within a minute or so of the rest of the network (well within the 5 minute gap required in order for Kerberos authentication to work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s still not working as cleanly as the older Red Hat Linux 9.0-based servers, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; working. Given that I&amp;rsquo;m still running these servers under an old version of VMware (which, technically, doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Linux 2.6 kernels) I may try upgrading to a new version of VMware to see if that helps at all.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Complete Linux-AD Authentication Details</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/22/complete-linux-ad-authentication-details/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2005 11:26:46 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/22/complete-linux-ad-authentication-details/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; These instructions are for Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server 2003 pre-R2. For the R2 release, please see &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2007/01/15/linux-ad-integration-version-4/&#34;&gt;these updated instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several articles posted here that discuss, in general terms, how to authenticate Linux against Active Directory. For example, see this brief article on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/13/linux-ad-integration-direction/&#34;&gt;broad direction&lt;/a&gt; of the integration, or this posting on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/07/18/minor-linux-ad-hiccup-fixed-hopefully/&#34;&gt;using computer accounts&lt;/a&gt; for Linux servers (most how-to documents I&amp;rsquo;ve seen discuss the use of a user account for this purpose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having to rebuild one Linux server a number of times in an effort to fix a separate problem (see this article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;NTPd problems with CentOS 4.1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/&#34;&gt;recurrence of the problem&lt;/a&gt; with CentOS 4.2). As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go through the process of configuring this Linux server (and preparing Active Directory) for authentication several times, and I found that I kept having to go back to my scattered and dispersed notes to remember what had to be done. In the hopes of correcting that, I am collecting all the pertinent information I have here in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Preparing Active Directory (One-Time)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a one-time preparation of Active Directory that is required. In order to authenticate Linux logins against Active Directory, Active Directory&amp;rsquo;s schema must be extended to include Linux-specific attributes such as home directory, UID, GID, and default shell. There are a couple of different ways to do this; I chose to use Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Services for Unix (SFU) to extend the schema. There are two reasons I chose SFU: 1) it&amp;rsquo;s free; and 2) the SFU schema is being included by default in Windows Server 2003 R2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once SFU has been installed and the schema has been extended, then the specific Active Directory accounts that are allowed to authenticate via Linux must be configured with a UID and other UNIX attributes. This is accomplished via the new &amp;ldquo;UNIX Attributes&amp;rdquo; tab on the properties dialog box of a user account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to create an account in Active Directory that will be used to bind to Active Directory for LDAP queries. This account does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need any special privileges; in fact, making the account a member of Domain Guests and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a member of Domain Users is perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the user accounts have been configured, then we are ready to perform the additional tasks within Active Directory and on the Linux server that will enable the authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Preparing Active Directory (Each Server)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each server that will be authenticating against Active Directory, follow the steps below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a computer account in Active Directory. When creating the computer account, be sure to specify that this account may be used by a pre-Windows 2000-based computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the following command at a command prompt to configure the new computer account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ktpass -princ host/fqdn@REALM -mapuser DOMAIN\name$&lt;br /&gt;
-crypto DES-CBC-MD5 -pass password -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL&lt;br /&gt;
-out filename&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to substitute the appropriate values for &amp;ldquo;fqdn&amp;rdquo; (the fully-qualified domain name of the computer), &amp;ldquo;REALM&amp;rdquo; (the DNS name of your Active Directory domain in UPPERCASE), &amp;ldquo;DOMAIN&amp;rdquo; (the NetBIOS name of your Active Directory domain), &amp;ldquo;password&amp;rdquo; (the password that will be set for the new computer account), and &amp;ldquo;filename&amp;rdquo; (the keytab that will be generated and must be copied over to the Linux computer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to rebuild the Linux server for whatever reason, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to delete the computer account you created and repeat this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Preparing the Linux Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the steps below to configure the Linux server for authentication against Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the appropriate Kerberos libraries, OpenLDAP, pam_krb5, and nss_ldap are installed. If they are not installed, install them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure that time is being properly synchronized between Active Directory and the Linux server in question. Kerberos requires time synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;krb5.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to look something like this, substituting your actual host names and domain names where appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[logging]&lt;br /&gt;
 default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log&lt;br /&gt;
 kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log&lt;br /&gt;
 admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[libdefaults]&lt;br /&gt;
 default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM&lt;br /&gt;
 dns_lookup_realm = true&lt;br /&gt;
 dns_lookup_kdc = true&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[realms]&lt;br /&gt;
 EXAMPLE.COM = {&lt;br /&gt;
  kdc = host.example.com:88&lt;br /&gt;
  admin_server = host.example.com:749&lt;br /&gt;
  default_domain = example.com&lt;br /&gt;
 }&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[domain_realm]&lt;br /&gt;
 .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM&lt;br /&gt;
 example.com = EXAMPLE.COM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[kdc]&lt;br /&gt;
 profile = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[appdefaults]&lt;br /&gt;
 pam = {&lt;br /&gt;
   debug = false&lt;br /&gt;
   ticket_lifetime = 36000&lt;br /&gt;
   renew_lifetime = 36000&lt;br /&gt;
   forwardable = true&lt;br /&gt;
   krb4_convert = false&lt;br /&gt;
 }&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;/etc/ldap.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to look something like this, substituting the appropriate host names, domain names, account names, and distinguished names (DNs) where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;host 10.10.10.10
base dc=example,dc=com
binddn cn=ldap,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
bindpw adldapbindpw
scope sub
ssl no
nss_base_passwd dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_shadow dc=example,dc=com
nss_base_group dc=example,dc=com
nss_map_objectclass posixAccount user
nss_map_objectclass shadowAccount user
nss_map_objectclass posixGroup group
nss_map_attribute uid sAMAccountName
nss_map_attribute uidNumber msSFU30UidNumber
nss_map_attribute gidNumber msSFU30GidNumber
nss_map_attribute loginShell msSFU30LoginShell
nss_map_attribute gecos name
nss_map_attribute userPassword msSFU30Password
nss_map_attribute homeDirectory msSFU30HomeDirectory
nss_map_attribute uniqueMember msSFU30PosixMember
nss_map_attribute cn cn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securely copy the file created using the &lt;code&gt;ktpass.exe&lt;/code&gt; utility above to the Linux server in question, placing it in the &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; directory as &lt;code&gt;krb5.keytab&lt;/code&gt;. (SFTP or SCP are excellent candidates for this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure PAM (this varies according to Linux distributions) to use pam_krb5 for authentication. Many modern distributions use a stacking mechanism whereby one file can be modified and those changes will applied to all the various PAM-aware services. For example, in Red Hat-based distributions, the system-auth file is referenced by most other PAM-aware services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;/etc/nsswitch.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to include &amp;ldquo;ldap&amp;rdquo; as a lookup source for passwd, shadow, and groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be it. Once you do that, you should be able to use &lt;code&gt;kinit&lt;/code&gt; from a Linux shell prompt (for example, &lt;code&gt;kinit aduser&lt;/code&gt;) and generate a valid Kerberos ticket for the specified Active Directory account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, any PAM-aware service that is configured to use the stacked system file (such as the system-auth configuration on Red Hat-based distributions) will use Active Directory for authentication. Note, however, that unless you also add the &lt;code&gt;pam_mkhomedir.so&lt;/code&gt; module in the PAM configuration, home directories will have to be created manually for any Active Directory account that may log on to that server. (I generally recommend the use of &lt;code&gt;pam_mkhomedir.so&lt;/code&gt; in this situation.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>NTPd on CentOS 4.2</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2005 16:08:20 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/19/ntpd-on-centos-42/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I started working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; (version 4.1 at the time, see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/08/brief-impressions-of-centos-41/&#34;&gt;impressions&lt;/a&gt; here) as a candidate replacement for the Red Hat Linux 9.0-based servers still in service on the network. Although I was (and still am) very comfortable with Red Hat Linux 9.0, it&amp;rsquo;s getting a bit long in the tooth and I wanted to update the servers to a more modern software base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I kept running into &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/08/16/strange-ntpd-problem-on-centos-41/&#34;&gt;issues with time synchronization&lt;/a&gt; on the CentOS server. This time synchronization issue did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; appear on the Red Hat Linux servers. I tried to resolve the issue, but never did find the solution. Instead, I just used ntpdate in a cron job. That seemed to work well enough, but I really wanted it to work PROPERLY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started working with CentOS 4.2 earlier this week, hoping that whatever had plagued me with the previous version wouldn&amp;rsquo;t afflict me this time. Unfortunately, the exact same problem has cropped up again, and I am at a loss trying to figure out why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. The output from &lt;code&gt;ntpq -p&lt;/code&gt; indicates that communication is occurring with the desired time servers, but the NTP daemon still keeps choosing to synchronize with the local clock. SELinux is disabled, so it can&amp;rsquo;t be interfering with NTP (I think that was the problem with the earlier CentOS 4.1 installation), &lt;code&gt;iptables&lt;/code&gt; is not running (so it can&amp;rsquo;t be a firewall issue), file permissions and ownership look OK&amp;mdash;what could I be missing? If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I switched to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, I was a heavy duty &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; user. I had Windows XP on my laptop, Windows 2000 on my servers, and used a Windows CE-based Compaq iPaq H3765. Since that time, I (of course) switched to Mac OS X on my laptop (a 15&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; G4 with SuperDrive); a mix of Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, and Windows on my servers; and a Palm OS-based handheld (currently a Treo 650, previously a Tungsten T3). As a result, I still had this iPaq sitting around doing nothing. So, on a whim, I decided to install Linux on my old iPaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://familiar.handhelds.org/releases/v0.8.2/install/&#34;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; at familiar.handhelds.org, I downloaded an &lt;a href=&#34;http://opie.handhelds.org/&#34;&gt;Opie&lt;/a&gt; image, installed the bootloader, and reflashed the iPaq from a spare 128MB CF card (I had a CF sleeve with external battery for the iPaq). After only a few minutes (the entire process was really quite painless), I was up and running with Linux on my iPaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having Linux running on the iPaq is great, but now I have to figure out what to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with this Linux-based PDA. Suggestions, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I coined the term &amp;ldquo;application specific VPNs&amp;rdquo; as I began exploring the many uses of tools such as SSH (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssh.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt; implementation, in particular) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt; (the open source &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer&#34;&gt;SSL&lt;/a&gt; wrapper). An &amp;ldquo;application specific VPN&amp;rdquo; is a technique for employing encrypted communication with a particular remote application that does not affect the operation of other applications (local or remote) on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, most VPNs employ technology such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPTP&#34;&gt;PPTP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsec&#34;&gt;IPSec&lt;/a&gt;. These protocols usually affect &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; traffic originating from that system (unless we use split tunneling). With an application specific VPN, only particular types of traffic are affected, and these particular types of traffic are wrapped in an encrypted SSH or SSL tunnel using either OpenSSH or Stunnel, respectively. Other types of traffic are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may seem old hat to long-time Linux, Unix, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; users, this is a relatively new concept to other platforms. Being a (fairly) new convert to Mac OS X myself, I found myself enjoying the tremendous flexibility offered by application specific VPNs. However, this functionality is certainly not limited to these platforms, and it is possible for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; users to utilize this functionality as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Some Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of how you can use application specific VPNs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=186&amp;amp;ntref=PROHOME_Main&#34;&gt;Citrix Presentation Server&lt;/a&gt;: Users can wrap Citrix ICA traffic in SSL using Stunnel; this avoids the need to pay for commercial solutions (although, quite honestly, the commercial solutions are typically easier to deploy and manage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;E-Mail: Lots of people talk about securing e-mail, but not usually in the context of securing client-to-server traffic. With Stunnel, you can add SSL support for IMAP, POP, and/or SMTP even if the server doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SSL natively. In fact, you can add Stunnel to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Microsoft Exchange&lt;/a&gt; to help bolster that product&amp;rsquo;s built-in support for SSL (such as using SMTPS instead of STARTTLS for encrypting SMTP traffic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote Desktop: This is a great technique for sysadmins. Need to use Remote Desktop to manage a Windows-based server remotely, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to run into security problems? Use Stunnel or OpenSSH to encrypt the RDP traffic. Stunnel, in my opinion, is particularly good here, since it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy to use the Windows port of Stunnel to establish an SSL listener on an arbitrary high port for this very purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Using Stunnel for SSL-based Application Specific VPNs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows, there is no graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring Stunnel; all configuration must be done with the &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; configuration file. A sample &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; file is found below; this file listens on TCP port 1494 and forwards traffic to TCP port 3389 on the same system. (Note that this would be a sample &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; file for a server-side configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CApath = c:\windows\system32\stunnel  
cert = c:\windows\system32\stunnel\stunnel.pem  
client = no  
service = SSLTunnel  
[rdp]  
accept = 1494  
connect = 3389
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Stunnel has been configured, running &lt;code&gt;stunnel --install&lt;/code&gt; will install it as a system service; this service can then be stopped and started through the Services MMC console just like any other background service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only half the work; you&amp;rsquo;ll also need an equivalent Stunnel configuration on the client side, since the Microsoft RDP client (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=80111f21-d48d-426e-96c2-08aa2bd23a49&amp;amp;DisplayLang=en&#34;&gt;Windows version&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; version) does not support SSL. Also, note that the SSL certificate used by Stunnel needs to be in PEM format (which is a nice lead-in to my article discussing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/02/certificate-conversion-using-openssl/&#34;&gt;conversion of certificates&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac OS X, there is a graphical utility for managing Stunnel called SSL Enabler. (Note that I was not able to find a home page for this utility; downloads can be found at various sites.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Linux, the configuration again involves editing the &lt;code&gt;stunnel.conf&lt;/code&gt; file and launching stunnel (either in the foreground or as a daemon). I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any GUI utilities for configuring Stunnel on Linux, but that certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Using SSH for Application Specific VPNs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with Stunnel, it&amp;rsquo;s also possible to use SSH to create application specific VPNs. Mac OS X comes with OpenSSH, as do most distributions of Linux and various flavors of BSD. Windows users can also find various ports of OpenSSH and utilities such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/&#34;&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt; that make it possible to use SSH for application specific VPNs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac OS X, the following command in Terminal will create an application specific VPN to encrypt IMAP traffic to a remote server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -L 1143:imapserver.domain.com:143 -N -f user@sshserver.domain.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same technique could be used to encrypt WebDAV traffic to a remote web server, other types of mail traffic (POP3 or SMTP, for example), RDP (for Remote Desktop), etc. Note that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well with HTTP traffic that requires the use of host headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few graphical utilities on Mac OS X for managing SSH tunnels; these include &lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/stm/&#34;&gt;SSH Tunnel Manager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leapingbytes.com/almostvpn&#34;&gt;AlmostVPN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not being a regular day-to-day Linux user (not on the desktop, at least), I don&amp;rsquo;t know of any SSH tunnel management applications, but I would be very surprised if they didn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Creating Site-to-Site Application Specific VPNs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the examples so far have been using SSH and/or Stunnel to connect endpoints (i.e., a single laptop or desktop computer) to a remote resource via an application specific VPN. However, it&amp;rsquo;s also easily possible to create application specific site-to-site VPNs, whose purpose is to secure only a particular type of traffic between two locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this example. CompanyA wants to send e-mail to CompanyB, but wants that e-mail to be secure. If both mail servers support TLS, then the organizations could use TLS to secure the SMTP traffic. If not, then the companies can use Stunnel to establish an SSL connection between two systems. HostA at CompanyA can use Stunnel as a client side application to listen for unencrypted connections and pass them as encrypted connections to HostB at CompanyB. HostB at CompanyB is using Stunnel to listen for encrypted connections and passes them unencrypted to the mail server at CompanyB. With a simple configuration, the mail servers at both companies can be configured to pass mail connections for other company through the Stunnel connection. With no additional cost and very little configuration, all e-mail traffic between the two organizations has now been secured. All this without the complexity of a typical B-to-B VPN and the associated access controls.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Using .Mac iDisk with a WatchGuard Firebox</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/12/using-mac-idisk-with-a-watchguard-firebox/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2005 00:37:38 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/12/using-mac-idisk-with-a-watchguard-firebox/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the strengths of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.watchguard.com/&#34;&gt;WatchGuard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.watchguard.com/products/appliances.asp&#34;&gt;Firebox&lt;/a&gt; series of firewalls is the inclusion of application-layer proxies for protocols such as SMTP, FTP, and HTTP. Whereas ordinary packet filtering firewalls and stateful inspection firewalls only control traffic based on IP address or TCP/UDP port number, application-layer proxies like those included in the Firebox look deeper into the packet to make decisions on information such as URL or MIME content type (for an HTTP proxy, for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this advantage also becomes a disadvantage as many application-layer proxies may not understand or be compatible with protocol-specific extensions. In this particular case, it&amp;rsquo;s the iDisk service provided by Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mac.com/&#34;&gt;.Mac&lt;/a&gt; subscription service. The iDisk service uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webdav.org/&#34;&gt;WebDAV&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification. It appears that, in general, most WebDAV services operate properly through the Fireboxs HTTP proxy (although some issues with Microsoft Exchange&amp;rsquo;s Outlook Web Access were reported with earlier versions of the WatchGuard Firebox System software).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iDisk service, though, apparently uses some non-RFC-compliant headers (note that this was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; confirmed with a packet capture). As a result, the Proxied-HTTP service (which employs, as the name suggests, an application-layer HTTP proxy) prevents these headers from being passed and therefore prevents iDisk from working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make iDisk work from behind a WatchGuard Firebox firewall, one of several steps must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the Filtered-HTTP service, which does not employ an application-layer HTTP proxy and therefore would not interfere with iDisk or other WebDAV-based applications or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modify the default properties of the Proxied-HTTP service to allow unknown headers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Proxied-HTTP service also provides for content filtering and reporting, it is generally preferred to use the HTTP proxy instead of an ordinary HTTP packet filter. The first option is therefore not the ideal solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the behavior of the Proxied-HTTP service is somewhat configurable. In order to make iDisk work with the HTTP proxy, the &amp;ldquo;Remove unknown headers&amp;rdquo; option must be unchecked in the configuration for the HTTP proxy. By unchecking the &amp;ldquo;Remove unknown headers&amp;rdquo; option, the Firebox will allow non-RFC-compliant HTTP headers to pass through the firewall, and iDisk will work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/08/ubuntu-510/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu 5.10&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;-based variant of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. After having installed and used Kubuntu, I decided to try Ubuntu, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnome.org/&#34;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;-based cousin. I downloaded the ISO image of the install CD last night and installed it today while reviewing HSRP configurations for an upcoming Cisco installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am equally as pleased with Ubuntu as with Kubuntu. I find that version 2.12 of GNOME, which ships with Ubuntu, is much better than the older versions of GNOME that I had used. In addition, the overall fit and finish of the distribution is very good, and I continue to enjoy using apt-get to update and upgrade packages on the system. As a matter of fact, the only downside to either distribution so far is that Kubuntu doesn&amp;rsquo;t include &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; by default (note that Firefox is included with Ubuntu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I currently have two older Compaq Armada E500 laptops that I&amp;rsquo;ve loaded with Linux&amp;mdash;one is running Kubuntu, and the other is running Ubuntu. Both work flawlessly, including full interoperability with my wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Mass Password Changes in Active Directory</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/08/mass-password-changes-in-active-directory/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2005 22:16:58 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/08/mass-password-changes-in-active-directory/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I had a need in a project to set the password for a large number of Active Directory accounts simultaneously. Here&amp;rsquo;s the solution I came up with for this particular need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use this technique, you&amp;rsquo;ll need &lt;code&gt;ldifde&lt;/code&gt; (included with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; (included with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; and most Linux distributions; Win32 versions available on the Internet), a text editor with search and replace functionality (advanced geeks are free to use &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;dsmod&lt;/code&gt; (from the &lt;em&gt;Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, export the list of user accounts out of Active Directory using ldifde. The command will look something like this (I&amp;rsquo;ve line wrapped here, as indicated by a backslash, but this should all be on one line):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ldifde -d &amp;quot;CN=Users,DC=company,DC=com&amp;quot; -r &amp;quot;(objectclass=user)&amp;quot; \  
-f c:\export-1.ldif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a file called &amp;ldquo;export-1.ldif&amp;rdquo;. Using &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, filter this file down to only the full distinguished names of the users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;less export-1.ldif | grep &#39;dn: &#39; &amp;gt; export-2.ldif
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; on a Win32 system. Also, on a Win32 system you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use double quotes instead of single quotes in the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; command. This creates a file called &amp;ldquo;export-2.ldif&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Load this file into the text editor and make the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove all occurrences of &amp;ldquo;dn: &amp;ldquo; (there is a space after the colon)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a double quotation mark before CN= at the start of each line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a double quotation mark after =com at the end of each line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save this modified file as &amp;ldquo;export-3.ldif&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, pipe this file through to the &lt;code&gt;dsmod&lt;/code&gt; program to set passwords for all the users in the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;type export-3.ldif | dsmod user -pwd newpass1 -mustchpwd yes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full help for the dsmod command line syntax is available using &lt;code&gt;dsmod /?&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dsmod user /?&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; filename&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the above command to log the output of the &lt;code&gt;dsmod&lt;/code&gt; command to a file. You can then use &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; to parse this file to ensure that the command was successful for all users.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2005 17:38:24 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/06/watchguard-firebox-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;A short while back, I posted an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/11/22/cisco-pix-vpn-and-active-directory-integration/&#34;&gt;Cisco PIX VPN and Active Directory integration&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to follow that article up with a version looking at integration between Active Directory and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.watchguard.com/&#34;&gt;WatchGuard&lt;/a&gt; Firebox VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the PIX-AD integration document, this article assumes that you have some basic knowledge of how to work with the WatchGuard Firebox series of firewalls. This article was written using version 6.2 of the WatchGuard Firebox System software and Windows Server 2003; other versions of either the firewall software or Windows should be similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Configuring the Firebox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to setup the Firebox. Use the Firebox software (Policy Manager, specifically) to perform the following configuration tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the server that is running IAS (or will be running IAS; see below) as a RADIUS server in the Authentication Servers dialog box (found on the Setup menu). Here, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to specify the server&amp;rsquo;s IP address, port number (the default of 1645 will be fine), and the shared secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instruct the firewall to use RADIUS by going to Setup &amp;gt; Firewall Authentication and selecting &amp;ldquo;RADIUS&amp;rdquo; as the authentication type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure the firewall&amp;rsquo;s Remote User VPN (on the Network menu) to use RADIUS by checking the &amp;ldquo;Use RADIUS to authenticate remote users&amp;rdquo; check box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, proceed with configuring PPTP-based remote user VPNs as usual. Be sure to add a rule allowing traffic to/from the pptp_users group; otherwise, VPN users will be subject to the same traffic restrictions as Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Configuring Internet Authentication Service&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything else, create a new global security group in Active Directory. Call it &amp;ldquo;pptp_users&amp;rdquo;, just like the name of the group on the Firebox. This is an important part of the glue that will bind the Firebox together with Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If IAS is not already installed, install IAS using the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it has been installed, launch it from the Administrative Tools folder on the Start Menu and we&amp;rsquo;ll proceed with configuring it for authenticating VPN connections to the Firebox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to grant IAS permission to read dial-in properties from user accounts in Active Directory. To do this, right-click on the &amp;ldquo;Internet Authentication Service (Local)&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Register Server in Active Directory&amp;rdquo;. Select Yes (or OK) if prompted to confirm. Note that if IAS was already installed, it may have already been registered with Active Directory as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, we can now configure the Firebox as a RADIUS client. Right-click on RADIUS Clients and select New RADIUS Client. In the wizard, specify the IP address (or DNS name) of the Firebox&amp;rsquo;s trusted interface and the shared secret. Note that this shared secret is the same secret key specified when configuring the RADIUS server in the Firebox previously. RADIUS clients use this to authenticate to RADIUS servers, so make it a reasonably strong password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now create a new remote access policy. Right-click on Remote Access Policies and select New Remote Access Policy. In the wizard, specify a name, select to create a custom policy, and then add the following conditions to the policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAS-IP-Address: This will be the IP address of the Firebox&amp;rsquo;s trusted interface. This helps to ensure that this policy only applies to VPN requests from this firewall and not from any other RADIUS client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows-Groups: This should be the &amp;ldquo;pptp_users&amp;rdquo; security group created earlier. Any user that should be allowed to authenticate on a VPN connection will need to be a member of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this policy should grant access. On the next screen, select &amp;ldquo;Edit Profile&amp;rdquo; to edit the remote access profile. This is important because we&amp;rsquo;ll need to verify that the RADIUS server is passing the correct information to the Firebox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Advanced tab, remove all the attributes listed there (Service-Type and Framed-Protocol are there by default) and then add the Filter-Id attribute. To this attribute, add the string value &amp;ldquo;pptp_users&amp;rdquo;. Click OK to save these changes to the profile and then finish creating the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make this policy the first policy (using the Move Up/Move Down commands in the IAS console), add a user to the group created earlier, and then test your connection. Remote systems attempting to connect via PPTP should now be able to authenticate the VPN connection using their Active Directory usernames and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this entry to correct some errors pointed out in the comments. Thanks for the feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a few updates to this weblog over the last few days. Nothing major, just a few minor changes here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to showing excerpts only on the index page. Of course, the archives pages (both category archives as well as monthly archives) were already showing excerpts only. Note that RSS feeds are still showing the full content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full entry page (the &amp;ldquo;single page,&amp;rdquo; in WordPress parlance) now shows the sidebar as well. It seems to me that this makes navigation through the weblog a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned the link to automatically post an entry&amp;rsquo;s URL to &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;; this link only shows up when reading the full post.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Protecting OWA with Apache</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/03/protecting-owa-with-apache/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2005 00:21:54 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/03/protecting-owa-with-apache/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Outlook Web Access (OWA) is the web-based interface for accessing e-mail and other resources handled by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, OWA&amp;rsquo;s popularity also makes it the target of numerous worms and security exploits. As a result, many organizations seek to deploy OWA behind a reverse proxy that can help shield OWA from web-based attacks and exploits. In this posting, I&amp;rsquo;m going to share information to help build a reverse proxy using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/httpd/&#34;&gt;Apache 2.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a skeleton of an &lt;code&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/code&gt; file to support Apache as a reverse proxy in front of OWA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80  
NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443  
ProxyRequests Off

&amp;lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443&amp;gt;  
ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.com  
ServerName webmail.domain.com  
DocumentRoot /var/www/webmail  
RequestHeader set Front-End-Https &amp;quot;On&amp;quot;  
ProxyRequests Off  
ProxyPreserveHost On  

SSLEngine On  
SSLCertificateFile conf/webmail-ssl-cert.pem

&amp;lt;Location /exchange&amp;gt;  
ProxyPass http://mail.domain.com/exchange  
ProxyPassReverse http://mail.domain.com/exchange  
SSLRequireSSL  
&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Location /exchweb&amp;gt;  
ProxyPass http://mail.domain.com/exchweb  
ProxyPassReverse http://mail.domain.com/exchweb  
SSLRequireSSL  
&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;Location /public&amp;gt;  
ProxyPass http://mail.domain.com/public  
ProxyPassReverse http://mail.domain.com/public  
SSLRequireSSL  
&amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key portions of this configuration are described below, along with some supporting information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NameVirtualHost:&lt;/em&gt; The NameVirtualHost directive enables Apache to use name-based virtual hosts on the specified IP addresses and ports. The parameter to the NameVirtualHost directive must match one of the VirtualHost definitions, as shown in the sample configuration, or else the content will be served from the default virtual host (the first virtual host listed in the configuration). Note that if the Apache reverse proxy will not be using name-based virtual hosts (instead using IP address-based virtual hosts or running only a single server instance), then this directive is not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RequestHeader:&lt;/em&gt; This directive instructs Apache to add a header &amp;ldquo;Front-End-Https: On&amp;rdquo; to requests sent to the internal OWA server. This header is proprietary to OWA and forces OWA to build URLs using &amp;ldquo;https://&amp;rdquo; references instead of ordinary &amp;ldquo;http://&amp;rdquo; references. This directive is required in order to terminate the SSL tunnel at the reverse proxy and use clear-text HTTP between the reverse proxy and the internal OWA server. This directive requires the &lt;code&gt;mod_headers&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProxyPreserveHost:&lt;/em&gt; This directive configures Apache to pass the original host header, supplied by the client, to the server to which the request is being proxied. (This is instead of the host name supplied in the ProxyPass directive.) Again, this facilitates the construction of URLs with the correct hostname when accessing resources inside OWA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SSLCertificateFile:&lt;/em&gt; Apache expects the web server&amp;rsquo;s SSL certificate to be in PEM format. If the certificate&amp;rsquo;s key is encrypted, Apache will prompt upon startup for the passphrase to the key (this prevents any form of automated startup). It is considered a security best practice to keep the key in a separate file (using the SSLCertificateKeyFile directive) in encrypted form and supply the password upon the startup of Apache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this configuration in place, the following benefits are realized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name-based virtual hosts are supported. This allows other URLs to also be proxied through this same reverse proxy server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSL encryption is offloaded from the Exchange server to the reverse proxy server. Traffic from the reverse proxy server itself to the Exchange server is standard, unencrypted HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When used in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modsecurity.org/&#34;&gt;mod_security&lt;/a&gt; (another Apache module), OWA is protected against a very significant majority of all web-based attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Apache to serve as a reverse proxy for OWA is a cost-effective way to add another layer of security to an Exchange-based messaging infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Certificate Conversion Using OpenSSL</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/02/certificate-conversion-using-openssl/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2005 16:08:35 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/02/certificate-conversion-using-openssl/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my various adventures with replacing Windows-based servers with Linux servers, I have had need on several occasions to take an SSL certificate (generated using Microsoft Certificate Services) and make it available to a Linux-based server. In some cases, it was to be used by the SSL wrapper &lt;a href=&#34;http://stunnel.mirt.net/index.html&#34;&gt;Stunnel&lt;/a&gt;; in others, it was for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apache.org/httpd/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the certificate needed to be in the PEM (originally Privacy Enhanced Mail, now a standard for encoding certificates) format. Windows, on the other hand, typically uses the PFX (PKCS #12) format for storing certificates. To prepare certificates for use on Linux, the certificates must be converted to PEM format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hopes that this information might be useful to others, here&amp;rsquo;s a process for converting from PFX to PEM using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssl.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of only a few items, the process is identical on Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx&#34;&gt;Windows &lt;sup&gt;2000&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2003&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These steps were confirmed using OpenSSL 0.9.7a on Red Hat Linux 9.0, using OpenSSL 0.9.6i on Mac OS X 10.2.8, and OpenSSL 0.9.7c on Windows Server 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the certificate is not already available in PFX format, use the Certificates MMC snap-in to export the certificate and the corresponding private key to a PFX file. Be sure to note the passphrase used to protect the PFX file; it will be needed later. If the certificate (and its corresponding private key) is already available in PFX format and the passphrase for the PFX file is known, proceed to step 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a terminal prompt, type &lt;code&gt;openssl pkcs12 -in _pfxfilename.pfx_ -out _tempfile.pem_&lt;/code&gt;. This will convert the PFX file to a PEM file. The OpenSSL toolkit will prompt for the import passphrase; this will be the passphrase specified in step 1. A PEM passphrase will also be needed; make note of the passphrase used here (it will be needed later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a text editor (such as vi on a Linux system, or Notepad on a Windows system), split the encrypted RSA private key and the certificate into two separate files. Remove all extra text, leaving only the text between the lines with the dashes. Make note of the filenames; they will be needed later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RSA key is currently encrypted; this will an automated launch for the application using the certificate. It will be necessary to decrypt the RSA private key. To decrypt the RSA private key, use the command &lt;code&gt;openssl rsa -in _encryptedkey_ -out _decryptedkey_&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;encryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the file containing the RSA private key, as separated in step 3, and &lt;em&gt;decryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the file that will contain the decrypted RSA private key). The OpenSSL toolkit will prompt for the RSA key passphrase; this will be the passphrase specified in step 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux or Mac OS X: To concatenate the decrypted RSA private key and the certificate into a single file, use the command &lt;code&gt;cat _decryptedkey certificatefile_ &amp;gt; _finalfile.pem_&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;decryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the decrypted RSA key produced in step 4 and &lt;em&gt;certificatefile&lt;/em&gt; is the file containing only the certificate, as produced in step 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Windows: To combine the decrypted RSA private key and the certificate into a single file, use the command &lt;code&gt;copy /b _decryptedkey_+_certificatefile_ _finalfile.pem_&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;em&gt;decryptedkey&lt;/em&gt; is the decrypted RSA key produced in step 4 and &lt;em&gt;certificatefile&lt;/em&gt; is the file containing only the certificate, as produced in step 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the concatenated file (finalfile.pem from step 5) with a text editor to add a blank line between the decrypted RSA private key and the certificate, and a blank line after the end of the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the certificate is ready for use. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be sure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to guard the unencrypted private key with extreme caution; loss of this file can result in the compromise of your system. Note also that most applications require that the certificates be owned by root and readable only by root (&lt;code&gt;chown root:root&lt;/code&gt; to make them owned by root and &lt;code&gt;chmod 600&lt;/code&gt; to make them readable only by root).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Updating Kubuntu to KDE 3.5</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/updating-kubuntu-to-kde-35/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2005 21:52:39 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/updating-kubuntu-to-kde-35/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt; 5.10, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;-based variant of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, normally comes with KDE 3.4.3. With KDE 3.5.0 just recently released, however, I wanted to update Kubuntu to use the latest version of KDE. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I had to do to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde-35.php&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;, I downloaded and added the appropriate GPG key. Once that was done, I used &amp;ldquo;apt-get update&amp;rdquo; to download the latest package information and &amp;ldquo;apt-get upgrade&amp;rdquo; to upgrade packages. That upgraded most of KDE, but there were a few packages that still refused to upgrade (they were reported by apt-get as &amp;ldquo;held back&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After poking around with apt-get for a while, I discovered that there was one missing file&amp;mdash;libgnokii2&amp;mdash;that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found in the apt-get sources. I manually reviewed the apt-get sources and finally found this package in the universe section of the main Ubuntu apt-get source. I edited /etc/apt/sources.list to enable the other sections, then manually installed the missing file with these commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get clean  
apt-get update  
apt-get install libgnokii2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then edited &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt; again to disable the other sources and upgraded the remainder of the KDE packages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get clean  
apt-get update  
apt-get upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last round of apt-get removed a few obsolete packages and then updated the remainder of the KDE packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; way of doing things, but it seemed to be the only way to make it work as anticipated. If anyone has a better way, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>HTTP Proxies and Command-Line Utilities</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/http-proxies-and-command-line-utilities/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I locked down outbound HTTP traffic from my network. All outbound HTTP traffic must now pass through a caching HTTP proxy. (The proxy also performs some content filtering so that the kids don&amp;rsquo;t access stuff they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my recent experiments with &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, I needed to download some small files using wget, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t because of the proxy. As it turns out, there is a really simple fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply set an environment variable called http_proxy to the correct URL of the outbound proxy server, e.g., &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://proxy.company.com:8080&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://proxy.company.com:8080&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or whatever. In the bash shell, this can be easily accomplished with this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export http_proxy=&amp;quot;http://proxy.domain.com:8080&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this environment variable was set properly (I messed up a couple of times trying to set it, getting my bash syntax confused with my tcsh syntax), wget and apt-get worked like a charm. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet tried this with yum on Fedora Core 3, but I anticipate that it will work there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/12/01/kubuntu-510/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;After wrestling with installing, configuring, and supporting Fedora Core 3 on an older Compaq Armada E500 laptop, I decided to break with my Red Hat/Fedora legacy and try &lt;a href=&#34;http://kubuntu.org/&#34;&gt;Kubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kde.org/&#34;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntulinux.org/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; variation. Ubuntu itself is a relative newcomer to the Linux distribution arena, based on (as I understand it) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.debian.org/&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous stints using Linux as my desktop OS, I&amp;rsquo;d always been partial to KDE instead of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gnome.org/&#34;&gt;GNOME&lt;/a&gt;. Some would say that it&amp;rsquo;s because KDE has traditionally been more &amp;ldquo;Windows-like&amp;rdquo; than the other Linux graphical environments; perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the case. I&amp;rsquo;ve typically found KDE easier to work with, and since this laptop would eventually be used by the kids I felt like ease of use was important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The install went very quickly and very smoothly. When the install was done, I then proceeded to update KDE to version 3.5.0 (which had just been released a few days before). Along the way, I learned a handy piece of information about HTTP proxies and command-line utilities (I&amp;rsquo;ll soon post information on that as well). Eventually, I managed to get apt-get to download and install the updated KDE 3.5 packages. I rebooted the system and found that I was now running the updated version of KDE. (Side note: There are still some KDE packages that won&amp;rsquo;t upgrade for some reason; I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on resolving that issue.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still too early to tell for certain, but I may just have found a new desktop Linux version.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/29/secure-remote-filesystem/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something that only a computer junkie could enjoy. In conjunction with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;FUSE&lt;/a&gt; project (now an official part of the Linux kernel as of version 2.6.14), an SSH-wrapped remote filesystems&amp;ndash;called &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html&#34;&gt;sshfs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;has been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/11/176206&#34;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; describes sshfs in a bit more detail and provides some additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? It means that for any remote system you can reach via SSH, you can mount that remote system&amp;rsquo;s filesystem inside an SSH tunnel. I can think of numerous possibilities, not the least of which involves easily updating a web site hosted on a remote web server without having to FTP (or SFTP) the files back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if only there was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; version of sshfs&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s currently only available for Linux and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; recently made a move to &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; up its XML-based file formats for Microsoft Office 2003 and the forthcoming Office 12. These file formats were offered to ECMA International for consideration as a formal open standard. However, the &amp;ldquo;license&amp;rdquo; for these file formats was merely a promise not to sue people violating its patents on the use of the file formats. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1894039,00.asp&#34;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1892757,00.asp&#34;&gt;these comments&lt;/a&gt; from a legal analyst regarding Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/office/xml/covenant.mspx&#34;&gt;Patent Protection Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, a promise &amp;ldquo;not to sue&amp;rdquo; from any large corporation&amp;ndash;not just Microsoft&amp;ndash;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be good enough for me were I a developer. Somehow, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that many developers are going to feel completely comfortable incorporating Office &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; XML-based file formats into their applications based solely on the Patent Protection Covenant. What happens when (not if) the covenant changes?&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my posting &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/11/21/zero-day-ie-exploit/&#34;&gt;Zero-Day IE Exploit&lt;/a&gt;, it has now been discovered that this exploit is no longer just a denial of service (DoS) flaw, but rather a flaw that can allow remote code execution (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.security.ithub.com/article/Unpatched+IE+Flaw+Is+Worse+Than+Expected/166164_1.aspx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information). As of this writing, there is no patch for this vulnerability and the only workaround is to disable Active Scripting in IE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q154036/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a Microsoft KB article that describes how to disable Active Scripting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, you can just switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; (which, by the way, is supposed to release Firefox 1.5 sometime today).&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>ipfw Rules for Bonjour</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/28/ipfw-rules-for-bonjour/</link>

          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/28/ipfw-rules-for-bonjour/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally published this information on my business website, but thought I&amp;rsquo;d reproduce it here in the event someone needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/&#34;&gt;Bonjour&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Rendezvous) auto-discovery service is used in a number of Apple-branded products as well as a growing number of third-party applications (for example, my HP Color LaserJet 2550N supports Bonjour). It&amp;rsquo;s used to advertise and discover &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; music libraries, and Apple&amp;rsquo;s Airport Admin Utility also uses Bonjour to discover &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/&#34;&gt;Airport Extreme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/&#34;&gt;Airport Express&lt;/a&gt; wireless base stations for configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonjour uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.multicastdns.org/&#34;&gt;multicast DNS&lt;/a&gt; (known as mDNS), part of the IETF standard known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeroconf.org/&#34;&gt;Zeroconf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that is well and good, but if you are using the built-in firewall you most likely are preventing Bonjour from working correctly. I grew frustrated trying to utilize Bonjour-related services while also keeping my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; protected against unwanted network traffic. Using a packet sniffer and Brian Hill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/brickhouse.html&#34;&gt;Brickhouse&lt;/a&gt; application, I observed Bonjour traffic and created a set of ipfw rules that can be used to allow this traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multicast DNS operates over UDP (IP protocol 17) with a destination port 5353 and a source port above 1024. The destination address is, of course, a multicast address (in the 224.0.0.0 range). Responses to mDNS multicasts originate from UDP port 5353, but are bound for a random high port above 1024. Simply defining a rule that allows traffic to and from UDP port 5353 wont work, because while outbound traffic will be correctly matched the responses to those outbound requests wont be matched and will be dropped (assuming the default action is to deny traffic). So, a sample rule to be added to ipfw might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add 2008 allow udp from 10.1.1.0/24 5353 to any 1024-65535 in via en0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This should be entered all on a single line.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule allows traffic from the source network 10.1.1.0 (the &amp;ldquo;/24&amp;rdquo; indicating a 24-bit mask, i.e., a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0) from UDP source port 5353 to any port above 1024 on any destination address inbound via the en0 interface. The en0 interface is typically the built-in Ethernet interface on most &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;-based systems. (Likewise, en1 is typically the built-in AirPort/AirPort Extreme wireless interface.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are tightly restricting outbound traffic as well, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a matching outbound rule (of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own experience has shown that adding this rule to my ipfw ruleset has allowed Bonjour to work as expected without sacrificing the security of my system.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Making Backup DVD Copies</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/27/making-backup-dvd-copies/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2005 20:23:16 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/27/making-backup-dvd-copies/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I love DVDs. Ever since I bought my surround sound system around Christmas of 2000, I have preferred DVDs over VHS for any new movies that we purchase. The big problem, though, is that DVDs aren&amp;rsquo;t nearly as durable as videotapes, and in a family with kids that&amp;rsquo;s a big deal. I have younger kids, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much for a kid to scratch a DVD when putting it into or taking it out of the DVD player. All it takes is one scratch and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the end of that movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before I switched to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, I have been making digital copies of every CD that I purchase, so that I can quickly and easily make another copy in the event that the original CD gets damaged in any way. The introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&#34;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; have made this easier. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered, even with the introduction of the 5th generation iPod with video capabilities, that I could do the same with my DVDs until just the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I set out to see if it was possible to do the same with my DVDs. I&amp;rsquo;d researched this a little bit earlier, so I already knew about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.losprimates.net/mtr/&#34;&gt;MacTheRipper&lt;/a&gt; (MTR), a program for extracting the digital video from a DVD. I used MTR to extract the video for &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt; to an external FireWire hard drive attached to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt;. That process went well, didn&amp;rsquo;t take too terribly long, and the resulting VIDEO_TS folder created by MTR worked flawlessly using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&#34;&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt;. I then turned to a program called &lt;a href=&#34;http://lonestar.utsa.edu/llee/applescript/dvdimager.html&#34;&gt;DVD Imager&lt;/a&gt;, which is designed to turn a VIDEO_TS folder into a DVD image that can be burned to a DVD. The problem, however, was that the VIDEO_TS folder and the resulting DVD image were 6.87GB in size. As a result, I was not able to burn the image back to a standard DVD-R using my PowerBook&amp;rsquo;s SuperDrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried another DVD (&lt;em&gt;Robots&lt;/em&gt; this time) and ended up with 4.62GB of data. OK, I thought, a single-layer DVD holds 4.7GB of data so I should be fine. Wrong! That didn&amp;rsquo;t work, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means I&amp;rsquo;m currently stumped as to the next step. A number of online searches have turned up recommendations for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.roxio.com/en/products/popcorn/&#34;&gt;Popcorn&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.roxio.com/&#34;&gt;Roxio&lt;/a&gt;), but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to see if I can avoid having to purchase software and instead make do with freeware and/or open source applications.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Another Take on Life(song)</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/22/another-take-on-lifesong/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2005 12:57:33 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/22/another-take-on-lifesong/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/09/25/lifesong-by-casting-crowns/&#34;&gt;earlier posting&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;Lifesong&lt;/em&gt;, the second CD by the Christian group &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.castingcrowns.org/home.php&#34;&gt;Casting Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke primarily about their musical style and their sound. At the time, I was so wrapped up in how the music sounded in comparison with their debut album that I was disappointed in this latest effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued listening to the CD, concentrating mostly on the tracks that I really enjoyed&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Lifesong&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Praise You in This Storm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Set Me Free&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Father, Spirit, Jesus&amp;rdquo;. As I listened&amp;mdash;truly listened&amp;mdash;to the words of these songs, and then took the time to listen to the other songs on the album as well, I realized that I was guilty of the very things that Casting Crowns sings about in these songs. And my first review was the perfect indicator of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many people practice Christianity on the surface. Sure, they go to church. They may even teach Sunday School, or lead a Bible study group. But do they really serve the Lord? Is their service&amp;mdash;my service&amp;mdash;just &amp;ldquo;empty hands held high&amp;rdquo;? How often do we high our true feelings from others, even our fellow Christians, becoming &amp;ldquo;happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples&amp;rdquo;? Can we see past that young unwed mother&amp;rsquo;s sin, see &amp;ldquo;past her scarlet letter&amp;rdquo; and actually get to know her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry isn&amp;rsquo;t just about a CD, though; that&amp;rsquo;s why I titled this post &amp;ldquo;Another Take on Life(song)&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not just about &lt;em&gt;Lifesong&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s time for us&amp;mdash;for me&amp;mdash;to move past superficial Christianity and into true service for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean full-time ministry, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean just going to church. It means serving the Lord with all that we are and in all that we do (and my use of the term &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; here includes myself). It means living a life that &amp;ldquo;brings a smile&amp;rdquo; to the Lord, where we take to heart Jesus&amp;rsquo; teachings and actually apply them in all areas of life, not just the areas that are convenient or comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means letting our life(song) sing to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Microsoft&#39;s Counter-Move</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/21/microsofts-counter-move/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2005 23:16:41 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/21/microsofts-counter-move/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The rallying cry around OpenDocument prompted Microsoft to make its counter-move. As fully expected, Microsoft is trying to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1891829,00.asp&#34;&gt;create a standard&lt;/a&gt; based on Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own (until now) proprietary XML formats. Please tell me you saw this coming, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With companies from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/&#34;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.corel.com/&#34;&gt;Corel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1877815,00.asp&#34;&gt;standing in support&lt;/a&gt; of the OpenDocument format, a new coalition forming in support of the format, and governments agencies such as the State of Massachusetts requiring the use of file formats such as PDF and OpenDocument, clearly Microsoft was worried. Otherwise, why try to create an alternate standard of your own creation? Why not just join the existing standards? Many are also saying that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s decision to include PDF support in the next version of Office is another attempt to keep from being shut out. After all, Office is a major cash cow for Microsoft, so the company will do whatever it can to provent a loss of marketshare (and revenue as a result).&lt;/p&gt;

(Apparently, only Windows Server 2003 with the Enhanced Security Configuration is immune.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No patch has been released, and no security advisory had been posted at the time this was written. A Microsoft security advisory was expected at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, switch to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. No, really&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft has posted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/911302.mspx&#34;&gt;security advisory&lt;/a&gt; about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This new blog is just about ready for public consumption. I just finished configuring the permalink structure so that all posts have a static URL, using a pretty common structure that includes the date of the post in the URL. (This seems to be a reasonably well-accepted practice.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the static URLs for permalinks also come static URLs for category archives and feeds. Unfortunately, it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back and rework any internal links I created in my own posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I reworked the template to include a hyperlink for adding a post&amp;rsquo;s URL to your &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; bookmarks. Now you can add an entry to your bookmark list with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Sony Keeps Digging Itself Deeper</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/10/sony-keeps-digging-itself-deeper/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2005 19:00:21 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/10/sony-keeps-digging-itself-deeper/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The furor over the rootkit technology used by Sony in their DRM software continues to grow. After Mark Russinovich &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html&#34;&gt;unveiled the truth&lt;/a&gt;, Sony released a patch that supposedly allows for the DRM technology to be uninstalled. Of course, Mark &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/more-on-sony-dangerous-decloaking.html&#34;&gt;reviewed the uninstallation&lt;/a&gt;, and he found it left a little bit to be desired (putting it mildly). Basically, it left you at risk of a blue screen of death. And Mark&amp;rsquo;s not the only one not satisfied&amp;ndash;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1883820,00.asp&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; cites several other security experts as well who are not happy with this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, First 4 Internet (the company behind the cloaking technology that Sony uses for their DRM software) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sonys-rootkit-first-4-internet.html&#34;&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt; to Mark&amp;rsquo;s posts and attempts to refute his findings. Finally, today, Mark posted more details on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/11/sony-you-dont-reeeeaaaally-want-to_09.html&#34;&gt;actual uninstallation process&lt;/a&gt; and what is required in order to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony just keeps digging itself deeper and deeper into this hole. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that the company uses stealth/cloaking technologies to hide their files. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough by itself that the DRM software is communicating back to Sony whenever a CD is played. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that the uninstallation process requires so many steps and is so complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make matters worse&amp;hellip;check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://entmag.com/news/article.asp?editorialsid=7033&#34;&gt;this news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it all together, and you get a mistake so massive that it could change Sony&amp;rsquo;s business fortunes. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; going to buy any Sony CDs or software now, after everything that&amp;rsquo;s been disclosed? I&amp;rsquo;m not, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. (Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have to worry about it that much since I&amp;rsquo;m using a Mac and not Windows, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different story for a different day.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>It Was Bound to Happen</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/09/it-was-bound-to-happen/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2005 16:17:25 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/09/it-was-bound-to-happen/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, I agree with the belief that operating systems and applications that don&amp;rsquo;t have a significant market share like Windows, IIS, and Exchange won&amp;rsquo;t get targeted as frequently and therefore will have a &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; security track record. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason that Linux, Mac OS X, and others haven&amp;rsquo;t seen as many security vulnerabilities and the oh-so-fun network worms that invariably accompany them. But I will agree that as these alternatives gain in popularity, more hackers are going to target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1882889,00.asp&#34;&gt;new Linux worm&lt;/a&gt; has recently emerged. I mean, it was bound to happen. Linux is surging in popularity, as Linus Torvalds and other developers continue to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1881470,00.asp&#34;&gt;add features&lt;/a&gt; to the Linux kernel and more and more corporations deploy Linux. Of course the malware authors are going to try something like this. I doesn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me in the least. While this one is fairly low-tech, you can bet that future variants of this worm (as well as new worms) will be more complex and more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also fully expect that the anti-Linux crowd will shout that this is the end of the line for Linux, just like the anti-Microsoft crowd shouts &amp;ldquo;Down with Windows!&amp;rdquo; everytime Microsoft patches a critical security flaw that could be exploited by an automated worm (side note: new Microsoft critical security flaw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS05-053.mspx&#34;&gt;patched yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, go have a look and make sure you are protected). This just isn&amp;rsquo;t the case. Neither Windows nor Linux are going to go away, and each of them has value for businesses today. The best bet for any organization is to use the product that best fits the need and then make sure that the product is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;properly &lt;em&gt;configured&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;properly &lt;em&gt;patched&lt;/em&gt;; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;properly &lt;em&gt;maintained&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these guidelines, businesses and consumers can safely deploy the products, technologies, and platforms that best meet their needs without falling prey to technology bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, I agree with the belief that operating systems and applications that don&amp;rsquo;t have a significant market share like Windows, IIS, and Exchange won&amp;rsquo;t get targeted as frequently and therefore will have a &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; security track record. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree that this is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reason that Linux, Mac OS X, and others haven&amp;rsquo;t seen as many security vulnerabilities and the oh-so-fun network worms that invariably accompany them. But I will agree that as these alternatives gain in popularity, more hackers are going to target them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1882889,00.asp&#34;&gt;new Linux worm&lt;/a&gt; has recently emerged.

          <title>Current Tech Projects</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/06/current-tech-projects/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2005 14:19:15 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/06/current-tech-projects/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, I like to post out here a list of my current &amp;ldquo;tech projects.&amp;rdquo; These are the things that I&amp;rsquo;m working on for my own network, things that I may or may not start recommending to or supporting for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my current list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;InterNetNews (INN): I had an installation of INN up and running a short while back, but had to resort to an ugly hack with stunnel in order to make SSL work from a newsreader. To get a clean build, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;ll just start from scratch with a clean installation. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centos.org/&#34;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; 4.1 again as I work on transitioning all my Linux-based servers to a newer Linux distribution, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be compiling INN from source instead of using a package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;-based antispam gateway: I&amp;rsquo;ve got an antispam gateway running right now (uses Red Hat Linux, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt; 2.1, SpamAssassin, Postgrey, Razor, DCC, and ClamAV), but I want to try building one using OpenBSD 3.8 (just recently released) and newer builds of Postfix, SpamAssassin, and Amavisd-New. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the advanced integration of newer versions of Postfix and Amavisd-New.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;XC Connect: I&amp;rsquo;ve also mentioned XC Connect before as well, but a previous installation proved to be unstable, and the Apache integration was less than stellar. In fact, the integration was nonexistent. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try a clean build of CentOS 4.1 and XC Connect to see if that will correct the stability and integration problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to wrap up the documentation for a few completed items, such as the Cisco VPN integration with Active Directory. Mac OS X integration with Active Directory is also on the &amp;ldquo;to do&amp;rdquo; list, but it will have to wait a little while&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ll need to find another Mac to &amp;ldquo;experiment&amp;rdquo; with instead of using my own PowerBook.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>OpenBSD pcn0 Driver Issue Resolved</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/04/openbsd-pcn0-driver-issue-resolved/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2005 08:48:20 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/04/openbsd-pcn0-driver-issue-resolved/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, sort of resolved. I was never able to make the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver (from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt; 3.8) actually work under &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt;, but I did find information on how to disable the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver and revert to the older &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2005-08/1314.html&#34;&gt;archived Neohapsis discussion&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a quick e-mail exchange with the author of the thread (who, thankfully, was very responsive and very helpful) led me to the solution. Some of it I had to improvise on the fly, but here&amp;rsquo;s the overall process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boot from the OpenBSD 3.8 boot CD image (I pointed the virtual CD-ROM drive in the VM directly to the corresponding ISO image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the OpenBSD &amp;ldquo;boot&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; prompt, type &amp;ldquo;-c&amp;rdquo; and press Enter. This takes you into User Kernel Config, or UKC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the UKC prompt, type &amp;ldquo;disable pcn&amp;rdquo; to disable the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type &amp;ldquo;quit&amp;rdquo; at the next UKC prompt to exit the kernel config and proceed with the boot process. If you watch the boot process, you will see OpenBSD load the &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver and identify the virtual NIC as &lt;code&gt;le1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all well and good, but how do you make the changes stick between reboots? Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten OpenBSD fully installed and are rebooting for the first time after installation, follow the steps above to use the &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver for the next reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &amp;ldquo;config -e -o nbsd bsd&amp;rdquo; command (see the relevant &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=config&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;sektion=0&amp;amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.8&amp;amp;arch=i386&amp;amp;format=html&#34;&gt;man page&lt;/a&gt; for details) to modify the kernel again, only this time saving the changes to the file named &amp;ldquo;nbsd&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon the next reboot after using the config command to create a new kernel file, specify the name of that new kernel file (&amp;ldquo;nbsd&amp;rdquo; in our example here) at the OpenBSD &amp;ldquo;boot&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that everything works OK (it did for me), rename the original kernel to &amp;ldquo;bsd.original&amp;rdquo; and rename your new kernel to just &amp;ldquo;bsd&amp;rdquo;. Then, upon the next reboot, the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver should be disabled and everything should work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this process, I now have two OpenBSD 3.8 VMs running and haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced any issues. Now, on to installing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clamav.net/&#34;&gt;ClamAV&lt;/a&gt; on OpenBSD&amp;hellip;.&lt;em&gt;(more details soon)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;pcn0&lt;/code&gt; network driver from OpenBSD 3.9 works perfectly under VMware (at least, on ESX Server). I have posted more information &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.scottlowe.org/2006/05/18/openbsd-39-on-esx-server/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Rootkit Technology in Sony DRM</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/rootkit-technology-in-sony-drm/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2005 19:16:28 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/rootkit-technology-in-sony-drm/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html&#34;&gt;very in-depth article&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Russinovich unveiled that DRM technology shipping with recent Sony BMG CDs actually installs &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit&#34;&gt;rootkit&lt;/a&gt; components onto your system. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of a vendor &lt;em&gt;unknowingly&lt;/em&gt; installing software on my computer(s) that contain rootkit components&amp;ndash;especially when those rootkit components could be used by malicious software packages to hide themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see that &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880543,00.asp&#34;&gt;picked up the story&lt;/a&gt; as well. (Note that O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s ONLamp.net is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8269?CMP=OTC-6YE827253101&#34;&gt;mentioning it&lt;/a&gt; as well.) Mark&amp;rsquo;s research is fantastic (as always), but not many people will get exposed to this news through him alone. Computer geeks like myself would, of course, but the people that really need to know this are the non-geeks. Any reasonably computer-savvy user is likely to want to pick up your average CD (from any number of distribution channels, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;) and copy the music off the CD. There are a number of very valid reasons for this&amp;ndash;ease of access, personal backup copy (ever scratch a CD?), etc. Copy-protected CDs limit your ability to do this without also installing stealthy rootkit components onto your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More links to other discussions on this topic can be found in section 8 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit&#34;&gt;this Wikipedia rootkit article&lt;/a&gt; (also linked above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is just plain wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s wrong to install this kind of software onto someone&amp;rsquo;s system. I can understand their desire to want to protect their &amp;ldquo;intellectual property,&amp;rdquo; but there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way than installing rootkits on your customers&amp;rsquo; computers.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Small OpenBSD 3.8 Speed Bump</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/small-openbsd-38-speed-bump/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2005 19:09:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/02/small-openbsd-38-speed-bump/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;My attempts to deploy the latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;, version 3.8 (released yesterday), have run into what I hope is only a small speed bump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous versions of OpenBSD (I first started using OpenBSD only a couple of versions ago, with the release of OpenBSD 3.6), the AMD PCnet adapter that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; presents to virtual machines was detected using the &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; driver. So, the virtual network adapter in a VM running OpenBSD 3.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.7 (and earlier versions, presumably) would be &lt;code&gt;le1&lt;/code&gt;. With the release of OpenBSD 3.8, the driver has changed to &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; (making the virtual network adapter &lt;code&gt;pcn0&lt;/code&gt;), and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work&amp;mdash;at all. Several attempts last night failed miserably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is hope on the horizon. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search turned up an &lt;a href=&#34;http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2005-08/1314.html&#34;&gt;archived Neohapsis discussion&lt;/a&gt; that raises the possibility of disabling the &lt;code&gt;pcn&lt;/code&gt; driver and using &lt;code&gt;le&lt;/code&gt; instead. I hope to try that in the next couple of days to see how it works, and I&amp;rsquo;ll post the results here.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>LSB Recognized by ISO</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/01/lsb-recognized-by-iso/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2005 19:12:19 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/11/01/lsb-recognized-by-iso/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880214,00.asp&#34;&gt;News surfaced today&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iso.org/iso/en/ISOOnline.frontpage&#34;&gt;International Organization for Standardization&lt;/a&gt; (ISO) has approved the Linux Standards Base (LSB) as an international standard. The LSB 2.0.1 core specification has been accepted by the ISO and will be published as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=41481&amp;amp;scopelist=PROGRAMME&#34;&gt;International Standard 23360&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, this is a big indicator of Linux&amp;rsquo;s maturity. Does Linux still need growth in some areas to be more competitive with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/netware/&#34;&gt;Novell NetWare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/&#34;&gt;Solaris&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, certainly. And yet, at the same time, Linux has strengths all its own as well. This recognition by the ISO of the Linux Standards Base serves to further legitimize Linux as a viable and worthy competitor to the proprietary operating systems listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(By the way, you&amp;rsquo;ll note that I did not include Novell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.novell.com/products/openenterpriseserver/&#34;&gt;Open Enterprise Server&lt;/a&gt; in the list of operating systems above because it is, of course, based on Linux.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting articles here for this long, but it&amp;rsquo;s time for another release of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbsd.org/&#34;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;. As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned here before, I do use OpenBSD for a few purposes on my network, and I&amp;rsquo;m confident that OpenBSD 3.8, due November 1, will find its way onto the network as well. (It&amp;rsquo;s fairly likely it will quickly replace OpenBSD 3.7.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know you are a true geek when you start measuring time in OpenBSD releases (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this for over 8 OpenBSD releases!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the OpenBSD web site has more information on ordering CD-ROMs or T-shirts to help support the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like using Unix-like operating systems (like Linux), then you should try OpenBSD.&lt;/p&gt;

Named &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelob&#34;&gt;Shelob&lt;/a&gt; (and soon to be renamed &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungoliant&#34;&gt;Ungoliant&lt;/a&gt; to prevent a conflict with another open source project), this system &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; works. Today. How is it, then, that a group of IT staffers at a university can come up with a system for network access control, but multi-million dollar companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cisco.com/&#34;&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t? I could say that this is a testament to the value of open source software, upon which the solution is built, but that seems fairly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/&#34;&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Galaxy&amp;rdquo; x64 servers (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x4100/specifications.jsp&#34;&gt;Sun Fire X4100&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x4200/specifications.jsp&#34;&gt;Sun Fire X4200&lt;/a&gt;) are wicked cool. Hot-swappable 2.5&amp;rdquo; Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) drives&amp;hellip;dual-core &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_8796,00.html&#34;&gt;AMD Opteron&lt;/a&gt; CPUs&amp;hellip;quad built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s enough to make me want one. Even better, they run Windows, Linux, or Solaris (all fully supported by Sun, too). It&amp;rsquo;s almost like having your cake and eating it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Protecting Against OpenSSL SSLv2 Flaw</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20051011.txt&#34;&gt;recent flaw&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openssl.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; (versions prior to 0.9.7h and 0.9.8a) highlights the fact that SSL is not a security panacea. (You can get more information about this flaw from the link above, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1870003,00.asp&#34;&gt;this &lt;em&gt;eWeek&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, or from &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/10/11/openssl_patches_security_hole.html&#34;&gt;this Netcraft post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disabling the SSL v2 protocol entirely is another way to protect against this flaw. Since OpenSSL is a set of libraries that other applications use to add SSL/TLS functionality, though, that configuration occurs within the specific applications, not within OpenSSL itself. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to protect &lt;a href=&#34;http://httpd.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; by disabling SSL v2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable SSL v2 support within Apache 2.0 with mod_ssl, use the following directive in the Apache configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SSLProtocol +All -SSLv2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables SSLv3 and TLSv1, but disables SSLv2. (Also see this Apache httpd &lt;a href=&#34;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslprotocol&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched for but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a similar workaround for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postfix.org/&#34;&gt;Postfix&lt;/a&gt;. The smtpd_tls_cipherlist and smtp_tls_cipherlist directives allow you to specify the supported ciphers and refer you to the OpenSSL documentation. However, the OpenSSL documentation didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to indicate a clear way of disabling only SSL v2. There did appear to be some discussion of adding this functionality in Postfix 2.3. If anyone knows of the particular keywords to specify with the smtpd_tls_cipherlist and smtp_tls_cipherlist commands for Postfix (or knows of any other way to disable SSL v2 support in Postfix), please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Bluetooth Interfering with GPRS on my Treo 650</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I noticed while using my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo650/&#34;&gt;Treo 650&lt;/a&gt; that I could not perform a HotSync operation via &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth&#34;&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; while I had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS&#34;&gt;GPRS&lt;/a&gt; connection active. As if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered what appears to be a further incompatibility between these two wireless technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears as if anytime I use Bluetooth on the Treo 650 for anything other than communicating with my wireless headset (a &lt;a href=&#34;http://motorola.digitalriver.com/DRHM/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayProductDetailsPage&amp;amp;SiteID=motostor&amp;amp;Locale=en_US&amp;amp;Env=BASE&amp;amp;productID=36061500&#34;&gt;Motorola HS850&lt;/a&gt;), I am unable to establish a GPRS connection. I get an error (the exact text varies) whenever I try to establish the GPRS connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed all the various settings on the Treo, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything that needs to be changed to fix this. This is terribly irritating, since I&amp;rsquo;d really like to be able to wirelessly HotSync my Treo to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/powerbook/&#34;&gt;PowerBook&lt;/a&gt; while I am away from the office without having to give up my data access via GPRS.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Just in Case</title>
          <link>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/08/just-in-case/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2005 17:58:09 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author>Scott Lowe</author>
          <guid>http://lowescott.github.io/2005/10/08/just-in-case/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the bug discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;905809&#34;&gt;KB905809&lt;/a&gt; several times in this blog. In reading those posts (or reading the KB article), you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen that you can use the SC.EXE command to set the security descriptors on the Service Control Manager to fix the bug. What happens, though, if you mess up the SC.EXE command?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this very thing happened recently. A systems administrator copied the required SC.EXE command line from a Word document, thinking it was safer to copy and paste than try to type the command line directly. As it turns out, the copied text from Word had a carriage return in it, and this caused the command line to terminate early (before all the security descriptors were applied). In fact, what happened is that all of the &amp;ldquo;Write&amp;rdquo; permissions were removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you run &amp;ldquo;sc sdshow scmanager&amp;rdquo; on a system running Windows Server 2003 SP1, you&amp;rsquo;ll get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;D:(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)  
(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA)S:(AU;FA;KA;;;WD)  
(AU;OIIOFA;GA;;;WD)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: The first section is the problem area, as this is what grants permission to the Authenticated Users group. In the fix described in KB905809, this section changes to grant Authenticated Users more permissions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular situation, all of the &amp;ldquo;Write&amp;rdquo; permissions&amp;mdash;everything after the &lt;code&gt;(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)&lt;/code&gt; section&amp;mdash;was accidentally removed. So, when the administrator realized what had happened and went back to try to fix it the system kicked back an &amp;ldquo;Access Denied&amp;rdquo; error message, because the permissions had been removed. With no permission to change the permissions, what could be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we found a fix. This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.exchangeserveradmin.org/ftopic24842_Could_NOT_change_mail_address_after_windows_server_2003_sp1.html&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; describes a Registry key that someone else had concocted trying to fix this very problem. In my discussions with Microsoft Product Support services, they analyzed this Registry hack and determined that the end result was the same as the SC.EXE command. By importing this Registry fix, we were able to restore the permissions that had been inadvertently removed. We then used SC again (with &amp;ldquo;sdshow scmanager&amp;rdquo;) to verify that the permissions were as they needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are fortunate that this Registry fix solved the problem. Had the Registry fix not worked, we most likely would have had to rebuild the server in question&amp;mdash;not a pleasant thought given that we had several hundred users already migrated over to that server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from this situation? Here are my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always type your commands by hand, instead of copying and pasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take appropriate precautions. In large-scale production environments, pull a hot-plug hard drive from the RAID array first. If things go south, shut the server down and reboot from the pristine drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running a command like this, pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real question, in my mind, is this: why isn&amp;rsquo;t Microsoft going to fix this bug? We may never know the answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
