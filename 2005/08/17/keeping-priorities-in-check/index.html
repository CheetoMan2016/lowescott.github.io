  <h1 class="post-title">Keeping Priorities in Check</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Aug 17, 2005 6:23 PM</span>
  <p>As technical people, we often immerse ourselves in our work to a far greater extent than people in other fields do. Why? I would imagine that most people, like myself, find this field to be as much of a hobby as it is a career. Sometimes, that&rsquo;s fine, as it gives us the necessary technical edge to excel in a highly competitive arena.</p>

<p>But sometimes we take it too far. As I was driving to work this morning, the song &ldquo;American Dream&rdquo; by Casting Crowns (great Christian rock group, by the way; see their <a href="http://www.castingcrowns.org/">web site</a>) started playing. Listening to the song&rsquo;s lyrics, I was reminded of the real priorities in life (all lyrics copyrighted by Casting Crowns):</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Not this time son I&rsquo;ve no time to waste</em><br />
<em>Maybe tomorrow we&rsquo;ll have time to play</em><br />
<em>And then he slips into his new BMW</em><br />
<em>And drives farther and farther and farther away</em></p>

<p><em>So he works all day and tries to sleep at night</em><br />
<em>He says things will get better;</em><br />
<em>Better in time&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>How many times have we worked late to finish up that &ldquo;important project&rdquo;? You know, the one that just couldn&rsquo;t wait until tomorrow? Too many times. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the first time this song has spoken to my heart; I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Casting Crowns from practically Day One, and this song has always been a powerful one. I thank God that I realized my priorities were wrong years ago, and started putting God and my family first. I say that not to lift myself up or to speak highly of myself, but to give God the glory. To the rest of you techies out there, take note: It <strong>is</strong> possible to be successful in this field without sacrificing what really matters in life.</p>
