  <h1 class="post-title">Cisco IOS = Windows XP?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Jul 29, 2005 3:43 PM</span>
  <p>Well, the <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/main.html">Black Hat</a> conference in Las Vegas certainly generated a great deal of excitement this past week. A security presentation was going to be given about a first-ever exploit for <a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</a> routers. From what I&rsquo;ve been able to decipher, Cisco had been working closely with <a href="http://www.iss.net">ISS</a>, the company whose researcher (Michael Lynn) was supposed to give the presentation, and both companies apparently agreed that the presentation needed further review. Cisco and ISS <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841232,00.asp">jointly filed an injunction</a> against Michael Lynn when he <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,103515,00.html">quit his job at ISS to give the presentation</a> anyway; this is after Cisco employees physically removed presentation pages from the books handed out at the conference and destroyed CDs containing information about the presentation.</p>

<p>It appeared as if Lynn was going to give a VoIP presentation instead, but then <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841166,00.asp">proceeded with the original presentation</a> anyway, even though he knew it would likely result in lawsuits from Cisco and his former employer. In the presentation, he likened Cisco&rsquo;s IOS (Internetwork Operating System) to Microsoft Windows XP, saying &ldquo;IOS is the Windows XP of the Internet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, Thursday, a court order was issued and <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,103561,00.html">all parties involved have agreed</a> to the terms of the court order, which restrict them from further sharing or disseminating any information about the security flaw.</p>

<p>Both Cisco and ISS have taken a real hit from this whole situation, and I can understand why. Cisco looks like it&rsquo;s trying to cover up security vulnerabilities; it was only after all of this that Cisco issued a <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20050729-ipv6.shtml">security advisory</a> discussing the vulnerability. If Michael Lynn&rsquo;s research was accurate, then it is appropriate for people to know so that our networks can be protected. Cisco network equipment running IOS does, indeed, power a large portion of the Internet. <em>At the same time</em>, if he violated the law and the terms of his agreement with Cisco by reverse engineering IOS, then he should not have publicized that information. <em>But then again</em>, it appears as if Cisco would not have released security information had Mr. Lynn not proceeded with the presentation, so&hellip;you see that this issue is sensitive and there are reasonable and understandable concerns on all sides.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done if I were in the same situation. The only advice that comes to mind is, &ldquo;If you do what is right, you can&rsquo;t go wrong.&rdquo; But what is <em>&ldquo;right&rdquo;</em> in this situation?</p>
