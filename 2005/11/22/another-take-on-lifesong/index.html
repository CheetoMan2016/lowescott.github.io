  <h1 class="post-title">Another Take on Life(song)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Nov 22, 2005 12:57 PM</span>
  <p>In my <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2005/09/25/lifesong-by-casting-crowns/">earlier posting</a> about <em>Lifesong</em>, the second CD by the Christian group <a href="http://www.castingcrowns.org/home.php">Casting Crowns</a>, I spoke primarily about their musical style and their sound. At the time, I was so wrapped up in how the music sounded in comparison with their debut album that I was disappointed in this latest effort.</p>

<p>I continued listening to the CD, concentrating mostly on the tracks that I really enjoyed&mdash;&ldquo;Lifesong&rdquo;, &ldquo;Praise You in This Storm&rdquo;, &ldquo;Set Me Free&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Father, Spirit, Jesus&rdquo;. As I listened&mdash;truly listened&mdash;to the words of these songs, and then took the time to listen to the other songs on the album as well, I realized that I was guilty of the very things that Casting Crowns sings about in these songs. And my first review was the perfect indicator of this.</p>

<p>So many people practice Christianity on the surface. Sure, they go to church. They may even teach Sunday School, or lead a Bible study group. But do they really serve the Lord? Is their service&mdash;my service&mdash;just &ldquo;empty hands held high&rdquo;? How often do we high our true feelings from others, even our fellow Christians, becoming &ldquo;happy plastic people under shiny plastic steeples&rdquo;? Can we see past that young unwed mother&rsquo;s sin, see &ldquo;past her scarlet letter&rdquo; and actually get to know her?</p>

<p>This entry isn&rsquo;t just about a CD, though; that&rsquo;s why I titled this post &ldquo;Another Take on Life(song)&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not just about <em>Lifesong</em>, it&rsquo;s about <em><strong>life</strong></em>. It&rsquo;s time for us&mdash;for me&mdash;to move past superficial Christianity and into true service for the Lord.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean full-time ministry, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean just going to church. It means serving the Lord with all that we are and in all that we do (and my use of the term &ldquo;we&rdquo; here includes myself). It means living a life that &ldquo;brings a smile&rdquo; to the Lord, where we take to heart Jesus&rsquo; teachings and actually apply them in all areas of life, not just the areas that are convenient or comfortable.</p>

<p>It means letting our life(song) sing to the Lord.</p>
