  <h1 class="post-title">Making Backup DVD Copies</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Nov 27, 2005 8:23 PM</span>
  <p>I love DVDs. Ever since I bought my surround sound system around Christmas of 2000, I have preferred DVDs over VHS for any new movies that we purchase. The big problem, though, is that DVDs aren&rsquo;t nearly as durable as videotapes, and in a family with kids that&rsquo;s a big deal. I have younger kids, and it doesn&rsquo;t take much for a kid to scratch a DVD when putting it into or taking it out of the DVD player. All it takes is one scratch and that&rsquo;s pretty much the end of that movie.</p>

<p>Even before I switched to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>, I have been making digital copies of every CD that I purchase, so that I can quickly and easily make another copy in the event that the original CD gets damaged in any way. The introduction of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> and my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> have made this easier. I hadn&rsquo;t considered, even with the introduction of the 5th generation iPod with video capabilities, that I could do the same with my DVDs until just the other day.</p>

<p>So I set out to see if it was possible to do the same with my DVDs. I&rsquo;d researched this a little bit earlier, so I already knew about <a href="http://www.losprimates.net/mtr/">MacTheRipper</a> (MTR), a program for extracting the digital video from a DVD. I used MTR to extract the video for <em>I, Robot</em> to an external FireWire hard drive attached to my <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">PowerBook</a>. That process went well, didn&rsquo;t take too terribly long, and the resulting VIDEO_TS folder created by MTR worked flawlessly using <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. I then turned to a program called <a href="http://lonestar.utsa.edu/llee/applescript/dvdimager.html">DVD Imager</a>, which is designed to turn a VIDEO_TS folder into a DVD image that can be burned to a DVD. The problem, however, was that the VIDEO_TS folder and the resulting DVD image were 6.87GB in size. As a result, I was not able to burn the image back to a standard DVD-R using my PowerBook&rsquo;s SuperDrive.</p>

<p>I tried another DVD (<em>Robots</em> this time) and ended up with 4.62GB of data. OK, I thought, a single-layer DVD holds 4.7GB of data so I should be fine. Wrong! That didn&rsquo;t work, either.</p>

<p>That means I&rsquo;m currently stumped as to the next step. A number of online searches have turned up recommendations for <a href="http://www.roxio.com/en/products/popcorn/">Popcorn</a> (from <a href="http://www.roxio.com/">Roxio</a>), but I&rsquo;m trying to see if I can avoid having to purchase software and instead make do with freeware and/or open source applications.</p>
